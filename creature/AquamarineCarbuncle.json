In ancient times, humans discovered that the gem on their forehead has the ability to store spells, which can then be used by anyone with practically no limitations.\\n\\nAny magic item around an Aquamarine Carbuncle gets slightly colder and gives off specks of blue light that are more visible the closer the item is to the creature. Unlike the rest of their kind, Aquamarine Carbuncles do not dislike water and sometimes they even enjoy shaking themselves next to others of their species while they are wet.",
