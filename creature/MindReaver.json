Indeed, they used to be rhinos, but a Nature Mage who sadly watched as they were hunted indiscriminately decided to give them a weapon with which to defend themselves. These creatures coexist with their non-magical siblings, constantly roaming their territories for the sole purpose of protecting them. If a hunter manages to land a hit on this creature, even if it is a deadly one, they will lose the will to hunt these mammals for the rest of their life.",
