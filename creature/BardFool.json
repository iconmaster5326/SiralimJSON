His sharp and cunning tongue was unparalleled in court, but he became seriously ill and was on the verge of death. The queen did not want to lose him, and had some Magi find a way to save his life. And they did so, in their own way. This creature makes people laugh like nobody else, but it also brings out their flaws and their darkest secrets.",
