They travel the plains day and night, and though their appearance does not make it easy for them to make friends, some have managed to settle in some villages thanks to their good deeds. However, although many of them prefer to earn an honest living taking care of livestock or helping with the harvest, some still retain their warrior spirit and would not refuse having a great adventure.",
