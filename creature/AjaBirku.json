According to legend, Aja Birku is the key to visiting parallel dimensions, as it mysteriously appeared during the Watcher War. Seven centuries ago, Helmholtz, a prestigious Mage, succeeded in extracting its core, a crystalline stone he called the Crystal Eye. However, before he could uncover its secrets, the city of Nex was besieged by Omnia\u0027s forces. The attack failed, but what was their real goal? That night, the Crystal Eye was lost forever.",
