The cold and dry climate, the large population of pines and the scarcity of predators for the Acrova are the biggest reasons. Indeed, these creatures eat wood, and they don\u0027t need much to satisfy their hunger. If they are in danger, they emit a scream inaudible to the human ear. Immediately, all the Acrovas in the vicinity gather at that point to face the threat.",
