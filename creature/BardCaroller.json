This forces them to keep traveling throughout the year, but they return to their place of origin for the winter festival that commemorates the victory against the Watchers. There they sing and dance with their relatives and childhood friends, strengthening the bonds that unite them. When these artists die during this period, a Bard Caroller is sometimes created. This creature\u0027s music brings out existing emotions and positive thoughts, and it can even make two people who hate each other hug.",
