There are numerous theories and stories about these creatures, including a small rumor that claims they come from an unknown continent in which there is no magic. In truth, a nuclear catastrophe filled that distant land with radiation, allowing only the most resilient Cockatrices to survive. Contagious Cockatrices are simply immune to nuclear radiation. James\u0027s pirates breed them as poultry, as they are also docile and resistant to many illnesses, and they have begun to commercialize them. Other ranchers, fearing competition, have taken advantage of these creatures\u0027 suspicious appearance to create a hoax, saying they carry dangerous diseases.",
