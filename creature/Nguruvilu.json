When they reach maturity, most of them descend the Sevinor River and travel to other regions. They hide under the water, motionless, waiting for prey to pass over them \u00E2\u20AC\u201D unless they detect magic. The presence of a Mage or a magical beast pushes them to the surface, as their scent is irresistible to them.",
