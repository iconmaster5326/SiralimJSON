On one occasion, Regalis presented the God of Time with a huge statue of himself, but the inside was hollow and contained millions of spider eggs. When someone is caught in the webs of the Arachnid Nest, Regalis considers them her property, and she keeps certain individuals she likes as her slaves.",
