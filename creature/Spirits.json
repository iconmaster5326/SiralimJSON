Most people believe a touch is enough for them to spread their inebriation, while others think they are an inexhaustible supply of beer. Because of this, there have been attempts to kidnap these creatures, some of which have been successful.\\n\\nSpirits is a calm and quiet creature, but it does not tolerate excesses. When it sees someone getting too drunk, it has no qualms about entering their body until they pass out.",
