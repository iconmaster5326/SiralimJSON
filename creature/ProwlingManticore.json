The last vestige of that frightful battle is the Prowling Manticore, an immortal creature that still embodies one of the greatest fears of mankind. It is almost seven feet tall, and its bite can easily tear a person\u0027s head off, and it has a dangerous ability to travel between realms and appear where it sees fit.",
