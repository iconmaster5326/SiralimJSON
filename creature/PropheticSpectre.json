He forced a part of Eternity\u0027s End to spill into the country through a rift, a huge amount of temporal energy to which the dark lord gave form to terrorize the world. During the process, one of the Orbs was corrupted and transformed into this creature. It is believed that its existence is linked to the curse, that killing it is one of the conditions to end it. Time is distorted around it, moving either slower or faster.",
