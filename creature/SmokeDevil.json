Since then it has traveled the world in silence with a lifeless gaze, leaving behind a mysterious cloud of dust. Wherever it goes there is anger, a fight, an argument, or maybe even a war, as if its very presence was the embodiment of Chaos. Although it carries a sword, it never gets into trouble and will only use it to defend itself.",
