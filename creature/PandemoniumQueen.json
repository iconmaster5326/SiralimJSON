Although harmless to most civilians, it can wreak havoc when summoned in the middle of nature, even when it simply opens its mouth to insult whoever summoned it. Specifically, Vulcanar thought it would be hilarious if an adventurer made it appear in the middle of the Cutthroat Jungle to set the trees on fire and make Torun mad.",
