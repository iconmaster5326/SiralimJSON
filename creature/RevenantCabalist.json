A thousand years ago they developed the necessary magic to live on the surface, and many abandoned their home to earn a living as mercenaries.\\n\\nRevenant Kings are often surrounded by a group of loyal protectors called Cabalists. They identify and dismantle conspiracies that threaten the King, generally through violence. In addition, they are skilled magic users who can sacrifice their own vitality to cast multiple spells at once.",
