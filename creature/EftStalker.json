They grunt to communicate their position, and they wave their tails to indicate where they are going to move.\\n\\nThe Eft Stalker is an expert at camouflaging itself in nature. It usually remains motionless while other Efts chase prey and lead them to the Stalker, so it can deliver the coup de grace. On its own, it can hide behind a bush for hours until some unwary animal gets too close.",
