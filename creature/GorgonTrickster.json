The only hope for her kind was to take over the naval fleet, guarded by a fearsome garrison of warriors. She connected her essence to her sisters\u0027 and created the illusion of a meteor shower to make them flee in disarray. The plan worked, but her boldness cost her her sight. Now she is the undisputed leader of her people.",
