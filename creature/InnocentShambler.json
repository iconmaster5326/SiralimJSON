Much of his fleet had sunk into the Boreal Ocean, and what remained was severely damaged. Still, there was room enough on their ships for the large numbers of exotic creatures they took with them.\\n\\nThe Innocent Shambler, as the pirate crew named it, was one of the undead creatures they found in the Boreal Ocean. They are meek, but skilled hunters, and although they do not need to feed, they have not lost their instincts. Occasionally, they capture prey and try to devour it, but pieces of chewed meat inevitably trickle out of the holes in their body.",
