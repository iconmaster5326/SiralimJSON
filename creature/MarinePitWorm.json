In their natural habitat, they feed on all kinds of creatures, including, of course, the Revenants themselves. Their diet on the surface is largely the same, and they act like voracious predators to anything that is not a cat. For unknown reasons, the mere presence of these small felines provokes an intense feeling of dread in Marine Pit Worms, driving them to speed away as quickly as they can.",
