He was mummified alive and hit with his own curse. Then the Sphinxes made their move. They knew that humans were spying on them and showed them just enough magic to create the mummies, which they awoke to sow chaos. The Swarm Mummy brought terrible hardship to Kaito and served the Sphinxes in their conquest of the Empire.",
