When Torun took the liberty of giving life to several volcanoes, Surathli and Azural gave him a good scolding. Vertraag also went to the Cutthroat Jungle, if only to enjoy the show. After a long discussion, Torun reluctantly made it so that these creatures would only be able to eject very hot rocks, which is still highly dangerous. Luckily, the creatures can only be found in volcanic areas.",
