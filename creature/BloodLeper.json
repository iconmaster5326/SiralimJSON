It is believed that this creature was once a Chosen of Gonfurian, which would explain its longevity. It was caught near Crux centuries ago, and then studied at the Magic University of Andolin. Now, the vaccine is cheaper and available to everyone. However, this creature escaped after an old ruler of Siralim attacked the kingdom, and now wanders the country.",
