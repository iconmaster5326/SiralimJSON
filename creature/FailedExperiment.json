Its magic powers were extraordinary, although insignificant next to Zonte\u0027s. After getting rid of the Failed Experiment and expelling the Occultists, he found that it reappeared under certain circumstances. The residual energy from Ainsworth\u0027s experiment had permanently linked the creature to the tower\u0027s structure.",
