Its very presence causes catastrophic events with serious consequences for anyone near the creature. However, the Cursed Slime itself is not evil, and it doesn\u0027t cause harm deliberately unless provoked. It decided to escape before the Djinn uprising and now wanders the world, involuntarily causing innumerable misfortunes in its path.",
