They are intelligent and inhabit a forest southeast of Undolim. They are excellent bakers, and there are actually several cooking schools throughout Rodia where these creatures teach. Gingerbread cookies in the shape of men, typical in Rodia, were first baked when a student made some for his Singerbread Man teacher, baking them in its own appearance.",
