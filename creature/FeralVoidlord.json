Centuries after that, when the Unification War came to an end, Milner found the Phase Rogue looting the royal crypts of Omnia. After stopping it, she realized there was no body inside Cerys\u0027s grave.\\n\\nFeral Voidlords only attack small villages. When they howl in the middle of the night, a dark aura escapes from their jaws and blackens the sky, absorbing all light from the moon and the stars. In their perfect cloaks of darkness, they move toward their chosen victims, sometimes helpless and unwary, other times aware that they will soon cease to exist.",
