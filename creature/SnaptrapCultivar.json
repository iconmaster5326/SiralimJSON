The so-called Snaptrap Cultivar feeds on insects and attacks larger animals when they try to pluck their fruit before it is ripe. Their attacks can be deadly, but once the fruit is ripe it drops on its own and the Cultivar Snaptrap stops responding aggressively if someone tries to get ahold of it.",
