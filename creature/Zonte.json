The tower was collapsing, and only he could stop the process. Inside, he saw the other Magi, his friends and colleagues, turned into eerie copies of his master. He hurried to point 0 and found her completely disfigured and catatonic. He had to remove the nine Nether Orbs to save the tower, and each one would consume seven years of his life. Looking like an old man but still feeling young, he teleported to Siralim, built on top of a gigantic Nether Orb, to become a God and stop the impending disaster. But he had miscalculated, for he needed a tenth Orb. It was then that Vertraag suddenly appeared and handed it to him.",
