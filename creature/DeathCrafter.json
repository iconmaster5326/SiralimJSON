It is a ritual that requires the sacrifice of a member of the Smith species. In the past, there were always volunteers among those who had lost their families and those who had nothing left but an empty, broken heart. These days, Death Crafters only sacrifice the Smiths who renounce their lives in the Scarlet Mountains or the Gorgon colonies.",
