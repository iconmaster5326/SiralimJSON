Many years ago, Rhylthar was stolen by a lieutenant of one of the first rulers of Siralim to use it as a catalyst for a powerful spell. In response, Azural cast an enchantment on Kalasag, breathing life into it and entrusting it with exacting vengeance on the king\u0027s man of old and recover what was his. However, the lieutenant never went back home, and Kalasag still seeks to fulfill its purpose to this day.",
