Caedo, his kingdom, became part of Gonfurian\u0027s realm, and from there he planned his return for centuries. Emlai, the last Caedo Seraph, seeks retribution for its king, who was crucified as a heretic for the second time so many years ago by none other than the ruler of Siralim. Emlai\u0027s thirst for vengeance will not be quenched until Siralim, and all the people who contributed to its king\u0027s untimely demise, are wiped from the face of Rodia.",
