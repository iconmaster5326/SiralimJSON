It is also one of the few intelligent Cerberuses, and it has other creatures such as Carvers or Fiends under its command. It leads them with an iron paw and makes them work in the mines of the Great Pandemonium. After a workday, it usually sits in its den and reads some books from the surface, accompanied by a servant whose job is to turn the pages.",
