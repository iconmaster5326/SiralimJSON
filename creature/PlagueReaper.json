Unbeknownst to the creature, he kept casting relatively innocuous curses on it until it transformed into a Cursed Reaper. When it happened it demanded explanations, but Sigmund locked it up and continued casting progressively more powerful spells on it. It finally became a Plague Reaper, bound to him as a slave. This creature brings misfortune wherever it goes, and touching its scythe horribly curses its victim.",
