They can withstand extremely high temperatures, even those of lava, and they detest the cold to the point of spitting fire left and right in order to heat up the environment. When one of these creatures thinks it has a parasite, it dives into the magma to immediately end the parasite\u0027s life. Vulcanar often points at these creatures while they are taking a bath to try to convince someone to jump into the molten rock with them.",
