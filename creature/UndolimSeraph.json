That which Surathli feared most was unfolding before her eyes, inexorably, endangering all her hopes.\\n\\nSeraphs are incredibly long-lived, but they cannot reproduce without the blessing of Surathli. When she gives it, a new Seraph is immediately conceived as a sphere of light that grows and takes shape for twenty-three months.\\n\\nThe Undolim Seraph is the most merciful of its siblings and always cares for them. It detests violence and, if possible, it will not spill a single drop of blood. Protecting the innocent is what matters most to it, so it will not hesitate to join a battle if Rodia\u0027s peace is in danger.",
