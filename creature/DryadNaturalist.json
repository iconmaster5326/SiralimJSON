At present, most forests are threatened by the activities of several intelligent species, especially those of humans.\\n\\nWhen a Dryad Naturalist finds a withering tree, she uses her power to create a sphere of life that she puts into the trunk. In this way, the tree recovers its color and continues to grow strong and healthy.",
