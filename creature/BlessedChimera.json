It keeps talking about the importance of their mission until other Chimeras get away from it, so Blessed Chimeras mostly interact among themselves. They detest all intelligent creatures outside the Amalgam Gardens, as they believe they would all plunder T\u0027mere\u0027s realm if they were not so scared.",
