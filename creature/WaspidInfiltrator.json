In fact, like wasps, they are the natural predators of other creatures that harm agricultural activities.\\n\\nWhen Waspids detect the presence of another hive near their territory, a fierce battle for resources begins. Waspid Infiltrators are extremely fast, and they wait for the bulk of the army to get all the attention before quickly entering the enemy hive and assassinating the queen.",
