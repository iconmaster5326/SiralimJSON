Its empty gaze and perpetual grin stand in stark contrast to the crude skull of hardened sludge it always carries. It taints the earth it walks on, leaving poisonous fungal gardens blooming in its wake. Some say it isn\u0027t a living creature at all, but a spirit that seeks only to keep its habitat undisturbed.",
