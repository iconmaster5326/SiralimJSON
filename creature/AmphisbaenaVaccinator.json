Today, these creatures are treated with respect and equality, and measures for their protection are no longer necessary.\\n\\nAmphisbaena Vaccinators can move any substance they ingest into an object with which they are in contact. In the case of vaccines, they can generate up to ten additional doses of it after it has entered their body.",
