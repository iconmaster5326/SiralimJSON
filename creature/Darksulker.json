Their last mission for the Auditors was carried out: to save not only the world, but the entire universe from an inexorable end. Their five new realms were ready, and the only thing that remained was saying goodbye. Everyone except Mortem and Tenebris set out on their journeys. \"River,\" said the god of Blood. \"It\u0027s Tenebris now, speak properly,\" he replied. \"You weren\u0027t always so compliant with the rules.\" Tenebris smiled at his response. \"You took Linta, you heathen.\" \"I know, so I want to give you something.\" The Darksulker appeared next to Tenebris. Mortem knew Tenebris was raising an eyebrow under his cloak of darkness, even though he couldn\u0027t see it. \"Come on, don\u0027t look at me like that. It\u0027s very smart, I\u0027ve told it about you and it agreed. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be great friends.\" The Gods embraced each other, so tightly that the earth itself trembled. \"Goodbye, Mortem.\" \"I\u0027ll miss you, Tenebris.\"",
