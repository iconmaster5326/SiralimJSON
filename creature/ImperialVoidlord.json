His findings led him to believe these creatures are the void itself, poured into the universe through the cracks the Watchers used to slip into this world. According to his hypothesis, the Watchers came from a dimension without matter, and when they slipped through the cracks, they involuntarily adapted to the laws of physics in our world.\\n\\nTouching an Imperial Voidlord is even more dangerous than touching the others, as even if someone manages to get away before being erased, their mind is assaulted by delusions and feelings of impending doom that often lead to suicide.",
