Unable to manifest himself in the real world, this God began to appear in the dreams of influential people, aiming to be worshipped, and to gain the power to escape the world of dreams. Caliban feels so envious of the other Gods, he wishes to get rid of them at any cost, and then take over Rodia and the rest of the world... or even destroy it. After the war ended, Rodian scientists found that the remains of his body reacted slightly in the presence of images of the Goddess of Darkness.",
