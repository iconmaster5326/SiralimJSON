It is common to find hummingbirds and other small birds around it, and a scientist from Vanelin discovered that they ignore the insects that get trapped in the moss, instead eating the moss itself. The scientist caught one of these creatures to study it and found out that its skin contained a hallucinogenic substance that is addictive to birds.",
