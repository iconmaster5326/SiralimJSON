For this reason, the Villous Wolpertinger is the only one of its kind who can pose a threat overnight, occasionally surprising the Smiths in the Scarlet Mountains, who have taken to setting up traps to finish them off. Fortunately, they are very noisy and never stalk their prey, so they rarely manage to cause too much trouble for the Smiths.",

    "(It bucks at the air anxiously. Perhaps a drugged carrot will settle it down.)",
