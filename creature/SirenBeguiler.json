However, many of them inhabit the oceans, and make their homes near rocky elevations where a ship could easily run aground.\\n\\nThe song of the Siren Beguiler evokes the feeling that great riches can be found in the direction of the sound. Many sailors have learned to distinguish the song, and they fire the cannons of their ships when they hear it to scare the creatures away.",
