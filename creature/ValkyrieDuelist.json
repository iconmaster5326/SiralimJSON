The only option left was to seek the help of the Desert Priest in Ahruna, but before Helmholtz and Milner could depart, the Duelist appeared with three hundred Valkyries behind her. This creature is the best Valkyrie warrior, a queen of queens who leads her people to give their lives for justice.",
