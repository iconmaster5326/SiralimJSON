Legend says they came after a slave ship sank, but it\u0027s uncertain whether they were the only ones who survived. Since there were no big animals around, they learned to hunt by hurling stones and sticks at small creatures like rodents, fish, and birds to get meat. Eventually, they created a weapon that was not only highly accurate and lethal but also returned to the thrower\u0027s hand by itself.",
