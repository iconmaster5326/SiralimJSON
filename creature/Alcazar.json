This was discovered in the years after the unification of Rodia by a famous scientist from a noble family who studied Bastions for a long time. After several weeks of research, he went inside a Bastion and the transformation happened. He replicated his experiment seven times before formulating his hypothesis, although he did not know whether this phenomenon can be triggered in other ways.",
