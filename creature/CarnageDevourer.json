From a ruined temple, the Devourer watched its allies fight each other. It quickly descended and approached them, avoiding energy rays, spells and stomps. It climbed the Mystical Giant\u0027s leg and jumped to its throat, making it howl and stop. The Corox waited cautiously. Then, the Devourer turned to the Observer, who wanted to \u0022tell\u0022 them something.",
