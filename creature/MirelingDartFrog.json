It can launch crystallized spines coated in neuroparalytic venom from its webbed fingers, and it climbs any surface to strike from a safer, more surprising vantage point. Some lizardfolk tribes see them as guardian spirits\u00E2\u20AC\u201Dthough they still keep their distance, treating them more like a curse than a blessing.",
