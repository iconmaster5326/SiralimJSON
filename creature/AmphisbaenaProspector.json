Sigmund finally took sides, and decreed that continuing the hunt of these creatures would be punished with exile to the Torture Chamber, whatever the crime committed against them.\\n\\nAmphisbaena Prospectors perform a wide variety of physical tasks, but they are best known for mining inside the gigantic Nether Orb on which the capital of Siralim was built, with the aim of extracting the raw material used to make Spell Gems. Due to the power it contains, most creatures eventually become ill, but Amphisbaenas are immune to this influence thanks to their biology.",
