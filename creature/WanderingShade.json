Many of her people collaborated for fear of reprisals, either from their neighbors or from the armed forces. The humans\u0027 numerical superiority forced many of such creatures into exile, until finally none remained in the kingdom, other than Elves. At present, the Shade she produced is the most powerful of all, and still roams the world insatiably searching for non-human creatures to annihilate.",
