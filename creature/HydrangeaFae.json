However, a study conducted recently at the Magic University of Vanelin established that a force powerful enough could destroy it. The Hydrangea Fae\u0027s wings glow in the dark, so they have a much harder time making a surprise attack at night. For this reason, they tend to hide in the leafy treetops, plummeting from the heights on their enemies.",

    "(Each Fae is making a rude gesture at you. One is sticking her tongue out, while another is proudly showing off her middle finger. Are they unaware that you could squash them like bugs?)",
    "(Upon your approach, one of the Fae pulls another\u0027s wings off. Luckily, these creatures seem to reproduce quickly enough that they\u0027re expendable.)",
