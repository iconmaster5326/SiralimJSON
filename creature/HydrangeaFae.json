However, a study conducted recently at the Magic University of Vanelin established that a force powerful enough could destroy it. The Hydrangea Fae\u0027s wings glow in the dark, so they have a much harder time making a surprise attack at night. For this reason, they tend to hide in the leafy treetops, plummeting from the heights on their enemies.",
