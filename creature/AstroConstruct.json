They have batteries inside them that gather this energy, but this is not an efficient way of recharging them during the rainy seasons or in places where the sky is often cloudy. In response to this, several alternatives have been devised: buying pre-charged batteries, recharging the batteries with spells, and the Astro Construct. This creature is constantly receiving energy, not only from the sun, but also from the stars and the moon, thanks to its much more powerful light receptors. Because this cutting-edge technology requires the use of one Nether Orb for every one hundred receptors, its price is simply astronomical.",
