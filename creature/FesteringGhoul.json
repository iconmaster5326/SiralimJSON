Before that, Milner defeated Sigmund\u0027s right-hand man, a Mage of great talent, in single combat. Due to his great power and the magic items he carried, the transformation was not complete. Like other Ghouls, the Festering Ghoul has lost his personality. However, it seems that he is able to direct other Ghouls and control their insatiable hunger. The authorities are still trying to find him to destroy him.",
