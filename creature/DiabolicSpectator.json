When two comrades-in-arms decide to resolve their differences by means of violence, this creature usually tries to mediate between them by puffing its chest and throwing a defiant look. This usually ends with the three of them fighting on the ground, so it\u0027s hard to tell whether its intention is really to stop the conflict or to join it as a show of strength.",
