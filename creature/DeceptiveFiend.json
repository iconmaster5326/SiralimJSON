When the God of Fire exiled the Fiends, it hid among them and escaped the Great Pandemonium. It saw that mortals also treated creatures as slaves, and it decided to devote its life to freeing as many beasts as it could from the yoke of their masters, regardless of whether they were trained animals, pets or faithful companions.",
