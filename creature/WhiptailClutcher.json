In a display of arrogance and indifference, he ordered the construction of a huge underground complex on the outskirts of the city, which he called the Torture Chamber. He created the Whiptail Clutcher to monitor the complex, as well as to inflict pain. This creature digs its thick nails into the necks of its victims, then lashes them with its tail repeatedly.",

    "(It\u0027s gently stroking one of your other creatures with a single finger. Creepy.)",
