His salary, unfortunately, did not allow him to hire the services of an expert, so he decided to search the underworld until he found someone. After a long haggling session, a price was agreed upon, and two weeks later that Mage handed the professor a box. He was satisfied, and opened it in the middle of class with the intention of scaring his students, saying \u0027This is what happens when you use an abacus too much, so be caAAAAAARGH!\u0027 The Abacus turned out to be more aggressive and vastly more dangerous than anticipated, and amid the laughter of his students, the teacher ran out the door with the Abacus chasing behind him.",
