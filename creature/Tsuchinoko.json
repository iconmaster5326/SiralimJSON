Rodia\u0027s biologists have not yet reached a conclusion about the creature\u0027s origin, though the most supported theory suggests they could have appeared because of a magic accident in which one or more Alementals had been involved. Anyone bitten by a Tsuchinoko will be inoculated with enough alcohol to get an elephant drunk.",
