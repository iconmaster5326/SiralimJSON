This creature sings a tender melody as she approaches those who exploit the resources of nature. Her voice produces a state of obtundation, preventing her targets from moving. When she is in front of her victims, she raises her right hand and tears a part of their soul, then buries it in the ground. From that moment, they entrust their lives to the protection of nature.",
