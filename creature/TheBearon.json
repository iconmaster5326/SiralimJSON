They are intelligent, although they do not communicate with words but with gestures and grunts. Most live in cozy wooden houses and wear monocles and hats. When a house is left uninhabited for a while, they reuse its wood to build again. Although they never leave the forest in which they live, they have several clearings to which they go twice a week to trade goods with outsiders and other Bearons.",
