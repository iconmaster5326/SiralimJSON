The inside of its body mainly consists of gears and metal tubes, through which flows a liquid brimming with magic that must be replaced every so often. Its skills in battle make it a precise and practically infallible killing machine, capable of adapting to all kinds of situations as long as it does not act alone. That is why, when the Auditors entrust it with a mission, it is always accompanied by five other creatures, usually war-trained Carnages and Fiends.",
