This rage led her to Gonfurian, and she asked him to eliminate the humans. The God of War laughed out loud, but he offered her a solution in exchange for passing a trial. The Nix accepted and had her own village fight a human town. They lost. Then, Gonfurian appeared before her and gave his favor to a mortal for the first time in history... plus another \u0022small\u0022 gift.",
