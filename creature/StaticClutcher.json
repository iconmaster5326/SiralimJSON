The Static Clutcher was his first great success, an obedient being who followed him everywhere and inspired fear in his subjects. He used it to punish those who did not follow his orders to the letter. This creature would grab its victims\u0027 faces and emit a painful discharge that burned their bodies and sometimes even killed them.",
