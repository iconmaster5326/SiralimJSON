As soon as someone gets too close, it\u0027ll spring into action and attempt to devour them instead. Unfortunately for Wacky Burger, this trick is old, and no one in their right mind would trust a giant burger just sitting there on its own. Caravans typically go around them or have their guards take action when they spot one.",
