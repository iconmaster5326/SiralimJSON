They can walk on lava without harm, so they generally lay their eggs on islets surrounded by this dangerous substance. If a flying creature tries to approach, the Fire Salamander spits fire at it to knock it down, where it dies to the heat of the magma. Vulcanar quickly became an admirer of these creatures.",
