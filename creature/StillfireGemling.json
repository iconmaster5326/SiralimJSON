If this is the case, Gemlings also have those memories, as they were created by using the gems of several Carbuncles, the descendants of those who failed to escape thousands of years ago.\\n\\nStillfire Gemlings are the most dangerous of their kind, since their bodies can produce enough heat to burn wood in a matter of minutes. Because of this, more than a dozen floors of the Refuge of the Magi were permanently closed after being consumed by the flames.",
