Although they lack intelligence, their ability to navigate their surroundings and respond to the stimuli around them is impressive.\\n\\nThe Battrap is the only Snaptrap in Eferia that does not feed on birds, mammals or reptiles, but on insects and feces. If another predator, including other Snaptraps, tries to devour it or the animals it shelters, it will either attack or flee depending on its chances.",
