By the time the authorities arrived in what was left of it, they found only the criminals\u0027 bodies and hundreds of civilian casualties.\\n\\nA group of Skeletons managed to get ahold of the Automaton blueprints and built Siege Automatons to assist them in their skirmishes. Their shots can go through walls even at long distances if they are charged for a minute before firing. In addition, they can release highly pressurized air that allows them to jump very high if they aim their cannons at the ground.",
