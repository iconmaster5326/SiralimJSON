Fragments of ancient texts preserved in the libraries of Undolim, treated as unverified myth, speak of a colossal worm Goddess who banished the sentient races of what is now Rodia from her realm for the crime of disrespecting the earth with their greed. Only Aeolian has been known to speak of her, and then only reluctantly, with noticeable sadness.\\n\\nThe recent machinations of Caliban have, however, unsealed her realm - and Anneltha has not seen fit to re-seal it to outsiders once more. Few adventurers have chanced the Forbidden Depths thus far, but reports of a crystalline hive swarming with brutal monsters, as well as a few distant sightings of Anneltha herself moving about the realm, suggest that these deep caves and their inhabitants have not suffered for their isolation from the world.",
