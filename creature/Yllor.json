After the incident that gave birth to the Occultists, Zonte met with them and offered them freedom, encouraging them to travel the world. The two creatures looked at each other with a mixture of amazement and fear, but they finally accepted the offer, in exchange for being able to return to their job during the winter and \"take advantage of the thermal field that surrounds the tower\". Yllor and Alakadan were training in Vanelin with the legendary Red Hat order when an old ruler of Siralim appeared and took over the kingdom. Yllor is very temperamental and much naiver than his partner, often starting tavern brawls when they visit a city.",
