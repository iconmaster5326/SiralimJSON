Taking advantage of the fact that most of the knights were on the walls, a very angry Crystal Smith headbutted one and stole his weapon. A riot had begun. The Smiths quickly ascended the castle with him at the helm, until they reached the throne room. There, the Smith fought in single combat against King Misery and ended his life, which earned him Gonfurian\u0027s favor.",
