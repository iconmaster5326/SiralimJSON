The spikes on its shoulders can pierce and break ice no matter how thick it is, causing serious injuries that, in the best of cases, leave the enemy unable to keep fighting. This is a useful skill when foraging, as there are many creatures trapped in the ice of the Frostbite Caverns that the Snowsting Yeti can easily extract.",
