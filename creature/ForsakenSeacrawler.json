The floating lake, where a large number of marine creatures were displayed, was one of the most popular tourist attractions. During the Unification War, the enchanted mechanisms that supported the lake were damaged, and it began to move freely around the city. The women who drowned inside transformed into Seacrawlers, creatures that can quickly move underwater and drown anyone who comes into contact with them.",
