When one of them stumbles upon a town, it does not stop until either someone stops it or it kills every single inhabitant. Like the rest of the Angels, they fought on the side of the Gods in an ancient war. To achieve victory, a sacrifice was necessary, as there can be no light without darkness. Someone had to contain that darkness, but only the wisest of them, the eternal one, knew that secret.",
