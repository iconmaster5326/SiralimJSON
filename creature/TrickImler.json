Many throughout history have tried to challenge death, however, even in recent times. One of the byproducts of this stubborn obsession to overcome a universal law is the Trick Imler, a lifeless creature animated only by magical impulses that run through an artificial nervous system. They were considered abominations at first, but in time the Imlings accepted them as cheap labor. As these creatures are mindless, they are capable of casting spells even with their bodies destroyed.",
