The Mage who directed the project was expelled from the Magic University of Siralim years ago for performing illegal tests on intelligent subjects, and she was locked in a regular prison with anti-magic protection. However, she managed to escape thanks to her contacts and started a new life. The authorities are currently trying to track down her fraudulent activities without much success.",
