When it sees a goat trying to climb or descend the mountain, it quickly moves towards it and headbutts it to make it fall. The color of its exoskeleton allows it to blend in with its surroundings, but if it moves carelessly, it can fall prey to large birds, so it remains motionless most of the time.",
