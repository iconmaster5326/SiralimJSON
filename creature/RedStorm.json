They snore when they sleep, which produces quiet thunder sounds that some people actually find relaxing, though they also grumble from time to time.\\n\\nWhenever a Red Storm meets a Blood Slime, they play by casting spells and lightning bolts at each other. If something threatens or scares its playmate, the Red Storm unleashes all its fury.",
