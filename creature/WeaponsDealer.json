They\u0027re always ready to trade any kind of weapon, though the price can shift depending on the buyer\u0027s circumstances. They know the smuggling routes well and offer everything from enchanted daggers to cursed hand cannons. Their eyes gleam when they spot something valuable in your pouch, and their deals aren\u0027t limited to gold or coins\u00E2\u20AC\u201Dsecrets, favors, or tools may serve as payment.",
