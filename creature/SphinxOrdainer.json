According to Queen-Pharaoh Hatesh, they rather built a house in which to serve them food and grant their wishes. Most of these requests were made by the Sphinx Ordainer, who, with carefully chosen words, obtained what it wanted from humans without them suspecting that they were being manipulated.",
