Gemlings feel a special affinity for Carbuncles and a deep hatred towards humans.\\n\\nWhen the Sapphire Carbuncle appeared in the Temple of Lies, Aurum admired it for a few seconds and decided to create the Whitestar Gemling. Unlike other Gemlings, the Whitestar has a certain self-awareness and is not guided by just instinct alone. Its goal is for Carbuncles to reclaim their place in the world, and its abilities allow it to summon any Carbuncle or Gemling that is less than a mile away.",
