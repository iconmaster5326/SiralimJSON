However, unlike them, there are several underground settlements exclusively inhabited by these creatures. Mining is what the Kobolds who live in these places mostly do, but they are sadly often attacked by creatures from the surface who want to seize the precious minerals they extract. That is why all Kobolds living underground receive combat training, even if they choose not to become miners.",
