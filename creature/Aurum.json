When a Carbuncle dies, its body becomes dust, but the gem on its forehead remains intact, retaining its power for centuries. Most of these gems ended up becoming food for the Crunchers, but many remained hidden. As if it were their fate, one by one they met and merged until, two thousand years later, they became a self-aware being. Aurum is faithfully devoted to order, and he loves feeling like the supreme being of his own world. He is the manifestation of pure magic, and is not affected by legends, hopes or faith. After the ruler of Siralim first met this God, one of their advisors raised the possibility that Vertraag had planned the existence of this deity from the beginning, since his mere presence seems to have a crucial role in the stability of the world.",
