Over time, the Revenants\u0027 weapons and techniques allowed them turn things around, so now Krakens only see them as emergency food, not to be taken lightly.\\n\\nThe Ironside Kraken\u0027s shell is so hard that the Revenants stopped using metals and minerals for their weapons and armor after they learned how to deal with these creatures. Some of their buildings are also made out of these shells.",
