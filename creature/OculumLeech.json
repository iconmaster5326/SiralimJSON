On the other hand, it seems like the survival instincts of these creatures have atrophied, or rather, were never really there in the first place.\\n\\nAlthough the Oculum Leech is able to see through its eye, it does not understand what it is seeing, and it is unable to use that information at all. When it tries to feed, its sight intereferes with its sense of smell, so it often tries to suck blood from a tree or a wall.",
