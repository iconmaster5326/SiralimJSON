As with Woodkas, owners of these creatures must periodically check them for any food they may have swallowed and remove it from inside their bodies. Predictably, Vermowls are more active at night, and can even break windows if they are not allowed to go outside for a while, unsupervised. Some mercenaries have already noticed this and tried to hunt them down. However, these creatures are aware of their ability to get other living beings drunk, so they always manage to slip away, leaving behind a group of people babbling incoherently on the floor, unable to move.",
