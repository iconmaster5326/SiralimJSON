One day, a Mage came up with the idea of taking advantage of this fact to create creatures that would join the ranks of the side for which he was fighting. The result was Legion, a creature who obeys the orders of its master, capable of fighting relentlessly for days. Although in the past these creatures could only be created with recently severed flesh, magic has advanced enough to be able to use the flesh of corpses a few days old.",
