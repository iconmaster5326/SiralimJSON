According to Revenant culture, it was an intelligent species who inhabited the Boreal Ocean and went extinct thousands of years ago. Their knowledge of magic rivaled that of the Ravens, and they tried to rule over the depths until, one day, they suddenly stopped attacking the Revenants.\\n\\nThe Shambler Benefactor is all that is left of that species, and it has lost all vestige of its former intelligence. James\u0027s pirates jokingly decided to name it Benefactor, as they never would have become undead had it not been for its curse.",
