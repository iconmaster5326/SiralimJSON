The bad dreams were meant to be channeled into these plush rabbits\u00E2\u20AC\u201Dbut after a few months, they started to come alive. Haunted by the only memories they\u0027d ever known, they began to lash out at anyone they encountered. It was later discovered that the bunnies had been sold without proper safety testing. Authorities are still searching for those responsible.",
