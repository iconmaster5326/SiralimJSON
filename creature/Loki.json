His cape billows dramatically even when there\u0027s no breeze, and his golden helmet murmurs promises you probably shouldn\u0027t trust. You\u0027ll catch him nicking pies, fish, and fruit at markets\u00E2\u20AC\u201Dbut usually he\u0027s handing it out to the poor living on the streets. He\u0027s also fond of swapping items in museums and shops, and planting fake yet convincing evidence on criminals who slipped past the law.",
