For the God of Balance, good and evil, and chaos and order must coexist for the world to function properly. However, his attempts to create balance are not always very successful, and he sometimes ends up helping to commit real atrocities that he later deeply regrets. Also, his way of dealing with people is chaotic, as he refuses to be nice as well as unfriendly to the same person all the time.",
