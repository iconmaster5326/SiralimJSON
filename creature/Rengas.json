He is good-natured and, unlike his father, does not get carried away with anger easily. He helps travelers in distress by guiding them to safe places or pointing out where they can find something to eat, but if he discovers that their intentions are looting or indiscriminate violence he will charge with all of his strength without a second thought.",
