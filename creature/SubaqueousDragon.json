It rules over the sea-dwelling Dragons that never come to the surface, although there is an ancient orb capable of summoning it and its armies if the cause is worthy of its presence. Some historians fear that eventually rulers of Siralim, who often interact with Nether Orbs, will corrupt the one that would summon this terrible creature, and add it to Siralim\u0027s hosts.",
