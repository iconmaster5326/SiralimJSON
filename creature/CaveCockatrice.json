Since they generally inhabit dark places such as caves or underground tunnels, they lost their sight in favor of very acute senses of hearing and smell, as well as a sixth sense that allows them to locate sources of heat around them through receptors on their featherless skin. The council of Rodia legalized breeding these creatures to eliminate Arachnalisk infestations.",
