He had dealt with the God before, and he knew it was no coincidence that he had appeared with such an offer immediately after the Djinn uprising. Zonte twisted his words to create the Frostfire Efreet. This creature\u0027s breath can freeze any surface, and its touch can cause ice burns on the skin. Vulcanar had no choice but to reluctantly exile this Efreet from the Great Pandemonium.",
