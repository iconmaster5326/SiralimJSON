Their civilization was turned to ash, and they have lived in small tribes since then, earning their living as mercenaries, hunters, thieves and raiders. The one in charge of dispensing torture in the new Asura \u0022empire\u0022 is the Fleshstomper. When a slave tries to rebel, this creature makes an example of them so that the others never think about it again.",
