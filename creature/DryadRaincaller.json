In the same way, healing the wounds of a Dryad also regenerates her tree.\\n\\nAeolian put special effort when creating the Dryad Raincallers. When the drought becomes an obstacle to the regeneration of a devastated forest, they perform a beautiful dance that summons the Storms. These creatures release their water where the Dryads believe it is most necessary.",
