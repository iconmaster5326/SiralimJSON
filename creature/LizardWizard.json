Their magical abilities, in general, are more than questionable, but some manage to develop certain skills that are useful for combat after arduous training that only a few are able to complete. Many of them are in the service of Rodia\u0027s army, others simply use their powers to make their daily tasks easier, and some decide to go on adventures. However, there are also those who join criminal gangs, usually to extort and loot regardless of who suffers for it.",
