It prefers not to fight physically, but when cornered it uses its stinger to keep enemies away. Only if this does not work will it lower its head and charge towards its enemies, possibly knocking them out. In its spare time it loves to read, especially plays. Indeed, some these creatures have recently visited Rodia\u0027s theaters.",
