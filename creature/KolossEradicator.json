If a Koloss is blunt, it means the creature has died, either in battle or after its five years of life have come to an end.\\n\\nKoloss Eradicators are bloodthirsty warriors who show no mercy on the battlefield. They take the destruction of their enemies so seriously that they are unable to stop, even when the battle is lost. Interestingly, these creatures are calm and kind when not in battle, preferring to resolve conflicts by talking things out.",
