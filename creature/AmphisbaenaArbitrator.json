Their greatest purpose is believed to have been to serve the kingdom for diplomatic purposes, but there is no evidence to confirm this theory. Many became psychologists at schools, large companies, unions or in their own offices. However, the best known and most beloved of their community were the Amphisbaena Arbitrators, thanks to their flawless performance and tireless fight for their rights.",
