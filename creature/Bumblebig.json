Bumblebigs do not form colonies or pollinate flowers. Indeed, neither do they feed or defend themselves against attacks. They simply wander around, apparently waiting to be eaten by another animal. Shortly after this, a new Bumblebig will mysteriously spring from the ground at a different spot in the Unsullied Meadows.",
