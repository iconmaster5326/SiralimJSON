Its web is not intricate and usually consists of a single thread that goes around several trees on ground level and low branches. This creature restlessly waits at the top waiting for a pull, at which time it will fall on whatever touched the thread without stopping to assess its chances.",

    "(It hands you a little doll made out of web silk. Ugh.)",
    "(It begins to raise up into the air as if it were floating, but upon closer inspection, its silken thread is just barely visible.)"
