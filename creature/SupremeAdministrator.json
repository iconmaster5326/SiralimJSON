To protect Ubi Concordia, a utopic city the Auditors built near the North Pole, thousands of robots were built with the sole purpose of exterminating anyone who managed to overcome the magical barrier Dragan and other Magi had erected around the city. To date, these robots have never had to execute their only order, but copies of them have slipped through the Itherian Realms, making it possible to see these creatures elsewhere.",
