For this reason, they generally wander alone through the Titan\u0027s Wound.\\n\\nIf it can, the Igneous Ossein spends most of its time under the blood of this realm, stalking prey that goes near the shore. That is why its body is on fire, as the temperature of this liquid is higher than lava\u0027s. This creature\u0027s fire is not extinguished even after its death, which seems to be related to the strange nature of the Titan.",
