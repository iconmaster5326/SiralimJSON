To protect the upper echelons, the city guard had a Minotaur Earthshaker destroy the last steps of the famous glass stairs. Hundreds of people lost their lives, and the women who were crushed became Swampdwellers. When they fight in a magic environment, they plant their tentacles on the ground to absorb the energy and strengthen themselves.",
