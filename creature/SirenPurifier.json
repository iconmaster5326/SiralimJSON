They are unable to differentiate between true villainy and simple selfish actions without importance. These creatures can summon blue fire in the palm of their hands that makes any creature hit by it fall asleep. This is especially dangerous for ships at night, as the Siren Purifier often targets the helmsperson and causes the entire crew to lose their way.",
