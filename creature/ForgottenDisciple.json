However, a sufficient number of believers can succeed in materializing less powerful creatures through unwavering faith. This is the case of the Forgotten Disciple, a creature that the villagers of a small town lost in the mountains treated like a deity. However, over many generations, the locals began to migrate to larger cities and towns, until the Forgotten Disciple saw the last adherents of the faith that had brought him to life die of old age. But that could not be the end. The Forgotten Disciple concluded that it he ate the corpses of its followers, the faith would re-emerge. Naturally, it had no effect, so it decided to go out in search of more corpses, in hopes of achieving its goal.",
