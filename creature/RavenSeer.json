Many of them take advantage of their powers to offer what they call clairvoyance services in exchange for a lot of money. Rodia\u0027s authorities pursue these activities, as they are considered fraud, but not anyone can stop these creatures. Generally, one or two veteran Magi with extensive knowledge of mentalism accompany the guard in charge of arresting a Raven Seer who is committing this crime.",
