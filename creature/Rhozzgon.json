His mother, a professor at the Magic University of that kingdom, took the drawing with her to her office. After a few days her secretary, a young Raven, misplaced the drawing, which ended up next to a pile of scrolls on which a ritual was to be performed. The result was a creature that would not let anything or anyone pollute the various ecosystems found in Andolin.",
