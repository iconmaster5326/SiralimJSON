However, the puppet is not affected by any damage to the blade, unless, of course, it is completely destroyed.\\n\\nThe fire of the Koloss Firebrand\u0027s puppet is generally not deadly, but it is essential when forging another Koloss. That is why Koloss Firebrands are respected and even revered within their communities, especially during the ceremony in which a new Koloss is finally brought to life.",
