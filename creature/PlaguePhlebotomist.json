Indeed, humans and other intelligent species learned this technique from them, as well as the fact that not all blood types are compatible. If a Plague Phlebotomist\u0027s patient was injured unjustly by another creature, it will sneak into their room while they are sleeping and draw all the blood they can without ending the creature\u0027s life.",
