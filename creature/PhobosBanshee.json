This rumor was initially spread by a doctor in Neralim after she realized how scared people were of the creature. When the doctor\u0027s colleagues found out what she was doing, they started to imitate her, and in a few years people went from running away from this Banshee to getting close to her, feeling more relaxed thanks to the placebo effect.",
