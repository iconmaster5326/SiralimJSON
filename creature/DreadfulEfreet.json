However, shortly after emerging from the lava of the Great Pandemonium, the Dreadful Efreet ordered the Obsidians to open a portal to the Refuge of the Magi, and they obeyed. The assault was so quick and effective that the Magi who accompanied them were more concerned with putting out fires than with attacking. Finally, the Dreadful Efreet forced the Djinn Ghula to leave the tower with the rest of the Djinns.",
