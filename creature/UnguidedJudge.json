It was for this reason that Erebyss and Surathli created the Angels, perfect killing machines for whom good and evil mean nothing.\\n\\nThe Unguided Judge received its name because ancient humans and other creatures believed it never inflicted any punishment. Soon after, they discovered that those touched by them on the forehead for ten seconds quickly lost the ability to speak and developed small appendages on their backs. Over time, these appendages became wings, and their entire bodies and minds changed until they fully became Unguided.",
