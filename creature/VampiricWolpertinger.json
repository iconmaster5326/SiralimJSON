Creatures like Trolls or the Smiths of the Scarlet Mountains often have trouble with them.\\n\\nDue to their unstable structure, some Wolpertingers mutate into the Vampiric subspecies without any specific cause. This creature\u0027s visual system does not allow it to receive clear images during the day. However, it is an insatiable predator at night, feeding on the blood of other creatures until they are completely dry.",
