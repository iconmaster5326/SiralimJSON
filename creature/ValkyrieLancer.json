The march of the Valkyries is never silent, despite the fact that they never communicate with each other. It is said that Valkyries do not speak, they sing. However, Valkyrie Lancers are the only ones who do so. Their voice sounds like a distant echo full of vigor and energy, and it fills their allies with courage.",
