This moment is called the Step, an event that literally changes them for the rest of their lives. Depending on their personality and what they have learned, their entire structure changes to grant them various abilities. Before the Step, their electricity is still weak and invisible, and does not allow them to do anything special, so they are required to live at Blue Emerald for their safety and learning.",
