However, these creatures possess an enormous strength, as well as claws that do not break easily despite their fragile appearance, which allows them to easily pierce shields and metal armor.\\n\\nThe scream of the Lurking Basilisk was thought for a long time to inflict serious injuries. The Magic University of Andolin discovered that their scream actually stops time for fifteen seconds, which allows them to attack all their enemies.",
