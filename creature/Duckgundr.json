They wanted find out what lies on the other side, and hopefully find a way to close them once and for all. For the first time in history, something went through the rifts in the opposite direction. However, what came back was organic, had a beak, and had duct tape on its tail. A tape that obviously was not enough to close the rifts. Dragan looked at the creature with a raised eyebrow and said \u0027Whatever is on the other side is laughing at us\u0027, although what really happened was somewhat different\u00E2\u20AC\u201Dthe intentions of whatever was on the other side translated into sarcasm when Duckgundr returned to our world, transforming it as a result.",
