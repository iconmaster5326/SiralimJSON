Along its entire length live the Benthic Guardians, creatures strictly controlled by Rodia\u0027s laws. They fiercely protect the waters, destroying anyone who dares pollute them. The problem? These guardians see anything unusual in the river as \"waste,\" making crossing their territory as dangerous as facing a bear\u0027s den.",
