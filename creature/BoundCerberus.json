In its first minutes of life it pounced on every creature it could find and tore them apart with its jaws on its way to the surface, where it continued the carnage. For several weeks it terrorized the people of Rodia, until, in a stroke of luck for the country, it encountered the Eternal Divinity. After a fierce battle, the Demigod vanquished the beast and left it somewhere no one could find it.",
