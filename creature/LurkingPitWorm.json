It may choose a traveler on the road, a woodcutter in the forest, a fisherman in the river. It follows the vibrations of their steps to their home. Then, in the darkness of the night, when all movements have stopped, the Lurking Pit Worm slowly emerges from the ground in its prey\u0027s bedroom and swallows them whole.",
