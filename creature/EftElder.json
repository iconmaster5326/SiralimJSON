  "lore": "Efts are terrifying carnivourous beasts. They have an excellent sense of smell, and their eyes allow them to detect living beings at great distances. They can also perceive heat in the dark.\\n\\nEfts usually live short lives, as Satyrs and Inquisitors exterminate them whenever they find their nests, and Efts sometimes cannibalize each other for food. However, some Efts survive long enough to become Elders. Efts have a somewhat confusing hierarchy, as the place each individual occupies is never clear, but herds that have an Elder always survive for much longer.",
