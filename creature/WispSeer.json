In addition to showing those who stare at them their final moments, they also increase their emotional sensitivity before bringing out their deepest fears. Since they first appeared, there have been hundreds of new cases of severe mental trauma, as well as numerous deaths, which has put the Council of Rodia in a tight spot.",
