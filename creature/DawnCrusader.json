There is a legend about four riders that lived great adventures on the backs of these creatures and saved a distant kingdom from the tyranny of the powerful X-Mage. The story of the Warriors of Dawn is also famous for being an impeccable satire of the genre, and it has been translated into more than 140 different languages throughout the world.",
