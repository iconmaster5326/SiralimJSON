Obviously, these insects would disagree with the previous sentence, but Snow Lilies won the hearts of some species such as humans, especially in the summer, when certain pests would ruin crops and bother people at night. Over time they evolved and some were domesticated, although they were never thought of as warriors to lead into battle. However, the Brownie Rebellion changed their fate. Many of them, loyal to these creatures, supported and fought alongside them tooth and nail, proving from that moment that they should not be taken lightly.",
