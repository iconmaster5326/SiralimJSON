It sneaks into cities through the sewers, and from there it tries to enter large food warehouses to eat the leftovers. If it is not hungry, it follows its nose to magic item shops, since it likes to collect such devices, probably because of their smell. Even so, it hardly ever succeeds, as the numerous thefts have forced the inhabitants of Rodia to reinforce their businesses\u0027 security and use traps.",
