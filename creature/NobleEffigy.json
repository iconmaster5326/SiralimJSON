They\u0027re the sharpest and most cunning of their species, though calling them \u0022noble\u0022 would be an exaggeration. After all, these creatures would never allow such privileges to exist within their own ranks. Still, they tend to dress in elaborate, eye-catching clothing, which is how the people of Siralim and other cities ended up dubbing them \u0022noble.\u0022",
