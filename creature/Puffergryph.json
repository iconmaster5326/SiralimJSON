River eels are their favorite delicacy and they know very well how to get hold of them, which very quickly has become an environmental problem, as these animals already had natural predators in that environment. The kingdom of Neralim was overwhelmed by this threat and had to ask the council for help four years ago, so today there is a group of hunters who have specialized in killing this species.",
