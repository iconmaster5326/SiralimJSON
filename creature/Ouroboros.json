It\u0027s one of the largest reptiles known, but it doesn\u0027t pose much of a threat to travelers or other creatures, as it feeds only on its own tail. Without this self-sustaining cycle, it would grow uncontrollably, struggle to move, and eventually die due to its inability to produce enough blood to sustain its size. Fortunately, its bite cauterizes any wound it causes, and its tail has no nerves, so it doesn\u0027t feel pain.",
