Unlike the rest of its kind, it only feeds on rocks and metal, and it cares about the Carbuncles\u0027 well-being. Many Carbuncles take advantage of the fact that the other Crunchers rarely attack this creature and hide their eggs in the cracks of its shell. For this reason, it is a multicolored creature whose pigmentation is determined by the species of Carbuncle that laid the egg.",
