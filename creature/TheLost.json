Their existence is considered a myth, and rumors suggest that their members have found the key to eternal life. The organization\u0027s network of contacts is broad enough to have executors in every continent, and though they usually are not formal members of the organization, they are also granted the gift of eternal life on rare occasions. When the Auditors decide to recruit an asset, and he or she refuses to appear before them, The Lost takes action. This creature appears during the night to subdue and gag the \"interested party\" with its extraordinary strength. The Lost was exiled centuries ago by its own kind, whose only habitat is on an island lost in the depths of the Golden Sea.",
