This is said to have been the first piece of land that Aeolian shaped, or at least the first piece of land he was satisfied with. It is said to be a very precious place for this God, and sometimes he even rests there. Every time Aeolian lands on the cool grass of this plain, a hundred Dervish each take shape from a blade of grass around him.",
