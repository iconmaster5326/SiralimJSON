This is largely due to the fact that this species has poor night vision, a big disadvantage when their strategy requires them to gallop at night. Centaur Rangers are able to interpret footprints and use them to estimate the direction taken by the enemy, something that in many cases allows them to lay a perfect ambush, shooting comfortably at their opponents from a safe distance.",
