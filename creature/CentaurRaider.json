Two hundred years ago, when the Elves managed to find a way into his village, he tried to protect his people armed only with a thick branch, but he was killed by the arrows of his enemies. When everything seemed lost, his heart began to beat once again in his chest. He had become Gonfurian\u0027s Chosen. Overflowing with new life, and alone, he managed to contain the invaders until the other warriors came to his aid.",
