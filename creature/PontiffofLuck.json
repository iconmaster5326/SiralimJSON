Naturally, several things went wrong and they ended up giving life to a creature obsessed with bar games, but with no special ability to excel in them, who was also a sore loser and kept causing problems. Finally, the students were made to clean the campus grounds for two weeks as punishment, and the creature was released after the dean herself cast a powerful spell on it that fixed its bad personality.",
