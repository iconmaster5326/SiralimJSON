They simply didn\u0027t want anything to do with species prone to war. However, as times changed and trade grew, some humans began interacting with Plains Felkats, and once their incredible skills became clear, they started joining police forces across Rodia\u0027s towns and cities. They are fast, stealthy, and relentless. Their extremely keen sense of smell lets them track anyone from just a trace of blood, making it easy to catch many criminals.",
