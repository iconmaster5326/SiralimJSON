These creatures are extremely aggressive and very dangerous, but if trained from a young age they can be obedient, making them exceptional allies. Ercath\u0027s western guard has trained many specimens, and they can be told apart from the wild ones by the blue capes, gold-plated crowns, and rings that adorn their heads and tails.",
