With a whisper, it asks the patient whether they were caused by another. With just a description, this creature finds the perpetrator and waits for them to become distracted. Then it pours the contents of its test tube into a glass. When drunk, the strange liquid causes the same injuries on the aggressor\u0027s body.",
