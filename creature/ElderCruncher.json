This phenomenon has not been studied in depth, as access to this realm was restricted until very recently.\\n\\nDue to their aggressive behavior, not many Crunchers reach the end of their life expectancy, but those who survive for over two hundred years become Elder Crunchers. These are the smartest of their kind and know how to choose their prey, so they sooner or later end up leading small groups of younger Crunchers.",
