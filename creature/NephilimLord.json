All Nephilim are dangerous, but the Lord seems to go even further. It does not usually target ordinary people, not even those who devote their lives to helping others. The Nephilim Lord prefers its victims to be powerful, influential people. A single wound from its sword will turn them into complete lunatics who will, for example, subtly unleash a plan to plunge their own nations into misery.",
