Although the Elves were never kind to visitors, some sheltered refugees in their forests until the war came to an end. Kapre was never a great warrior, but he was a good friend of Elinar even after he became Morning Star. When he learned that Elinar was going to leave this world forever, he accompanied him without thinking twice. Apocranox, already a God, gave his friend the gift of eternal life, and from that moment they lived together in the Blood Grove. Kapre has learned to fight over the years, as he wanted to help the Satyrs and Inquisitors in their eternal war against the Efts.",
