  "lore": "Cherubs are known on extremely rare occasions when exposed to specific stimuli to initiate a rapid transformation, suddenly accumulating tremendous amounts of energy before vanishing in a burst of intense light. To this date, this has only been known to happen twice \u00E2\u20AC\u201D once with a freezing cherub hewn of ice, and with another sickly cherub perpetually enveloped in salty water.\\n\\nThe most volatile and mercurial of their kind, Chandra Cherubs often seem to exist in synchronicity with unseen cycles and forces. Their energies change, surging and waning, sometimes quite suddenly. While research into Cherubs is already considered notoriously difficult, the Chandra Cherub\u0027s ceaseless defiance of any known form of reason or reality is of infamous befuddlement to Magi.",
