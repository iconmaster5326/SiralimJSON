Alexandria spent forty years designing and building this creature, and he is very proud of the result. Unlike Clockworks, the sound of the gears turning inside Adaxial is imperceptible to human ears. Adaxial is so attuned to the God of Falsity\u0027s realm that it can detect any problems in its machinery in a sixty mile radius.",
