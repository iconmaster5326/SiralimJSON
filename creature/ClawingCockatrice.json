It continues to inhabit temperate forests and mountains where it can hunt relatively effortlessly. Its most notable adaptation is its webbed tail, which allows it to swim and dive at high speeds, making it easier for it to catch river fish, a staple of its current diet.",

    "(It\u0027s preening its feathers, pulling out all manner of disgusting-looking parasites.)",
    "(This particular Cockatrice seems to be a cut above the rest. Though it may appear to be stupid, you can\u0027t help but sense its immense intellect.)"
