The bond between the rider and its mount is established from a young age, and they generally do not separate until one of them dies. All of them follow the ideals of Meraxis, which are not too clear to most humans and other intelligent species, and the God of Bliss grants them special powers in exchange, like the Faith Hunter\u0027s ability to bring its allies back to life.",
