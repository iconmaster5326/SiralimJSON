Moreover, they exist in several eras simultaneously. If a version of them dies at some point in history, the others disappear.\\n\\nWhen the Pit Wraith Lord enters battle, its eyes shine with an unusual red color. Temporal distortions begin to appear around it that send its enemies to the immediate future, allowing it to strike them while they are unprepared. However, it often finds it hard to use the same trick twice on the same opponents.",
