He is the oldest Elf currently alive and as he himself affirmed, the most bored with life in the forest. In his time, he was at once the most skillful Huntsman and Rogue, and over time he developed his own style. One of his exploits as The Drifter was to find the entrance to the town of the Centaurs, although he did not participate in the attack as he disagreed with the orders to annihilate them.",
