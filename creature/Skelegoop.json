This species believed all kingdoms had to abide by their laws, and they never surrendered, even when not a single warrior was left alive. A necromancer Solomon who had studied magic in Siralim managed to revive some of his own kind by creating the Skelegoop. They say the purple, goo-looking glow surrounding its body is the will of the Solomon to enforce their laws. At present, this species has advanced, and it seems like it is no longer interested in imposing its laws, although they remain very strict in their own kingdom, so Ercath, Rodia, and other nations are paying attention to their movements just in case.",
