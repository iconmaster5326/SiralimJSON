Though they rarely touch the latter, finding them unappetizing, they\u0027ll make do if there\u0027s nothing else left after a forest fire. They reproduce on the hottest summer nights, drawing others of their kind with rainbow-colored flashes visible for miles. For centuries, the people of Rodia have gathered around their mating grounds to watch the light show.",
