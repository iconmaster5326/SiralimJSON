The first to summon this creature was Baker, a renowned Life Mage who had recently lost her great love. One night, she went into the cemetery and looked for her lover\u0027s crypt to bring her back to life with an experimental spell. But something went wrong, and instead of bringing her back, the spell gave life to the building in which she was buried.",
