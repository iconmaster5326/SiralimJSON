To contain the magic in that place, Milner and other Magi performed a complex ritual that sealed all these curses within the trees. At night, the shape of a face appears on the trunks, then emerges from the bark to wander around, floating through the thick vegetation. They are not aggressive creatures, and they do not need to feed, but they will respond with full force to any attack.",
