However, during their mating rituals, both females and males use their horns to fight their counterparts and choose the most appropriate partner.\\n\\nViridian Wolpertingers are the most patient of their kind. They are discreet, and that makes them the most dangerous. They use their color to camouflage themselves in the meadow without being detected, simply waiting until prey approaches to go for the throat.",
