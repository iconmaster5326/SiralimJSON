It stood in front of a huge temple crowded with people and unceremoniously fired countless rays through its eyes. The temple fell to the ground, burying hundreds of people beneath it, and that was only the beginning. The Sentinel is a relentless watchman, but what was it watching over? Why did it leave its home dimension? The truth was not revealed until the Ophans arrived.",
