  "lore": "When a Lightning Cerberus gets angry, the electricity that runs through its body reaches 200 volts, so it can throw anyone who touches it into the air. This creature does not need to bite; it channels its electrical energy into a sphere capable of burning any creature it touches to a crisp. It is especially dangerous on rainy days, because just touching the water on the ground where it is standing can lead to electrocution.",

    "(It\u0027s chasing its own tail, which would be cute if this creature wasn\u0027t a massive, three-headed, carnivorous beast.)"
