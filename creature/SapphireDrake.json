Sapphire Drakes, dragons with great resistance to pressure, make their homes in this lake. When their eggs hatch, the hatchlings have to fend for themselves to survive in an extremely harsh environment. After three years they become able to take flight and leave the lake, but only the strongest make it out alive.",
