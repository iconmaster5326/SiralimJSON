Her realm is one of the few that are popular tourist destinations. The reason is very simple—all works of art that are conceived in the world and the different realms are manifested in the Astral Gallery as living beings. Of course, this phenomenon attracts a multitude of thugs who want to kidnap them to sell or kill them for fun. The Godess of Creation vehemently condemns their actions and does not hesitate to reward anyone who helps her deal with this problem.",
