When Taylor exhaled his last breath, the Malignant Spirit emerged from his mouth and escaped the Torture Chamber. Since then, it restlessly travels the world in search of humans and other creatures. Its very presence is terrifying, and it only gets worse once it approaches. It can enter people\u0027s thoughts and bring out their fears and worries, not letting them disappear from their minds.",
