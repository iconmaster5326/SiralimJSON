When the Valkyries took flight to face the fearsome threat, arrows and spells quickly rained down on them. Many Valkyrie Knights died before getting through the walls, and most did not make it to the ships. They protected their sisters, who quickly reached the engines thanks to their sacrifice, causing the ships to fall from the sky.",
