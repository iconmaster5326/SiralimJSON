However, they travel to snow-covered towns and cities during the winter and slide around the ground, leaving a trail of ice that Brownies and children from many species use as a skating rink. They do not usually cause problems, so adults let their children play with them, but they get restless if they are forced to remain in a warm location, producing hail and cursing while moving around in a frenzy.",
