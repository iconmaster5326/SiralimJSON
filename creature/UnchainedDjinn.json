Others had disappeared with several Djinns, never to return. Zonte and Ainsworth finally decided to give life in secret to the Unchained, a loyal Djinn. It told the others a story of suffering at the hands of the Magi so they would leave the Refuge of the Magi, but its words had an unexpected result, and the insurrection began at that very moment.",
