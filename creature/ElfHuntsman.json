Therefore, an Elf Huntsman does not hunt animals, but intruders, or as they call them: \u0022Utter fools\u0022 or \u0022Insolent creatures who think they don\u0027t need an invitation to enter our domains and sully them with their disrespectful customs\u0022. Elf Huntsmen are the fastest and most skilled. They jump among the branches and hide in the leafy trees to remain undetected before they fall on their enemies and end their lives.",
