In fact, he is the youngest God in existence, and still knows practically nothing about Rodia or the world in general. He is able to understand human emotions even if he does not feel them, but it is difficult for him, so he often asks if he has made a mistake when it comes to evaluating them. He is not hostile to outsiders, but he does not understand why they seem to enjoy killing each other, as he does not see the point of risking something so fleeting and fragile in that way for a few coins.",
