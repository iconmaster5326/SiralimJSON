When he turned 55, he was recruited by the Auditors and became Eve, one of their most dangerous agents.\\n\\nToxdwellers feed on the nuclear waste produced by the experiments carried out in the Caustic Reactor. After the first outsiders reached this realm, Venedon thought it would be a good idea to equip these creatures with extra weapons, such as the stinger he gave the Toxdweller Bloodbather.",
