One bite is enough to double a human\u0027s heart rate and leave them unable to sleep for three days, at which time the effects begin to subside. Due to its effects, it is now being studied in Rodia for its medical applications. On the other hand, if it is correctly cooked, the impact and duration of its effects can be reduced to the point of being harmless.",
