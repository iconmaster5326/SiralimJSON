After being abandoned by their masters during a siege of the temple where they lived and trained, they swore revenge before dying in that battle. Their unshakable faith in their beliefs, coupled with the betrayal they felt and the magic that floated there, made the last wish of these young warriors come true. Once again on their feet, they dispersed and massacred both those who had killed them and their own masters, who had abandoned them. However, their thirst for blood did not go away, and they continue their indiscriminate slaughter across the continent to this day.",
