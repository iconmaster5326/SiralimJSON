To do so, she ordered her Water Salamander to activate the powers of the artifact. The soul of the warrior, trapped in the mittens, manifested and took over the creature\u0027s body. The Salamander soon turned on its owner and ended her life. It then left the ruined temple, looking for more adversaries to defeat.",
