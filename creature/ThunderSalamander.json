A large group can alter the path of lightning bolts at will and decide where they will hit with incredible accuracy. In addition, the electricity that runs through their body interacts with the magic around them, sometimes allowing them to replicate it effortlessly. The authorities of Rodia strongly recommend keeping a safe distance from these creatures.",
