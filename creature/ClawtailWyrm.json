They are powerful warriors, but of simple ambitions, and have managed to repel attacks by armies of other countries with resounding success, although given the extreme weather conditions of their domains, they have never suffered a proper siege. However, their strength resides in the creatures they host, tails that move independently, but cooperatively. When a Clawtail Wyrm reaches adulthood, a ritual is performed in which it is bound to one of these parasites for the rest of its life.",
