However, adding the strength of the Apis to the battle against the Watchers was not enough to change the fate of the empire. The Apis Warrior, made by the Usurper to protect it, knew that it was fighting for a lost cause and rebelled to free its people. The Apis turned against the Sphinxes, who could not prevent their escape on the last day of Kaito.",
