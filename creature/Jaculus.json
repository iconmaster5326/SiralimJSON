They are small, but fast and fierce. In fact, they hardly ever bite or claw at their prey, instead striking with their whole bodies at high speed to kill them. Currently, some mercenaries and bounty hunters in Rodia keep these creatures as companions, though a permit is required, and releasing them is forbidden, as it could destabilize many of the country\u0027s ecosystems.",
