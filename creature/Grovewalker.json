The result was the Grovewalker, a fiendish being who wanders without conscience, withering everything it touches, spreading disease wherever it goes. The businessman and the Death Mage were caught and imprisoned, and work is currently under way to eliminate these creatures from the ecosystem, with satisfactory results.",
