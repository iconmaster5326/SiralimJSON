  "lore": "River was a powerful Magi who studied in the Refuge of the Magi. There, he formed a great friendship with another student named Hexilo. After a few years, his friend began to develop an affinity for the dark arts, and later, when River left the Refuge of the Magi, he began to hear stories of a necromancer who terrorized a kingdom near Siralim, beyond the lands that would be known as Rodia a few centuries later. Convinced it was his old friend, River traveled to that kingdom and found that he was right. For several years they fought each other until both of them joined the Auditors. Together with four other agents they formed the Enclave of Six, and River led the group. The six Magi carried out many missions throughout the world. Following the incident in the Refuge of the Magi, River transformed into Tenebris. He soon found that using divine power was not much different from using magic, something that neither Apocranox nor Venedon had done up to that very moment. Using each other\u0027s power he helped them create their own realms. He later created the Bastion of the Void together with Mortem, and, after saying goodbye to his friends, he left this world.",
