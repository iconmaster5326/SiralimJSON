When a battle begins, it sets it up like a spear and charges its enemies, striking powerful blows with the stone-carved skull at the end of it. Sometimes, the wood that supports it ends up breaking, but that does not prevent it from fighting with what is left of the banner, or its fists, kicks, and shield.",
