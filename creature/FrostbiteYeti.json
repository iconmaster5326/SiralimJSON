It is a peaceful creature that lives in the snow and does not look for trouble, but faced with the arrival of explorers that are scared by its presence and hunters who seek its skin, it often has to look for allies to get by. At times, it is deceived by other creatures into forming a group, and at nightfall they end its life to get some money out of its coat.",
