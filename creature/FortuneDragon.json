When the claws of a Fortune Dragon pierce an enemy\u0027s flesh, they transmit an infectious disease that is lethal if left untreated for twenty-four hours. Dragon Queens usually have them attack any outsiders who break the laws of the Unsullied Meadows, leaving them alive. This is meant to serve as a warning due to the extreme pain the victims suffer during the course of the disease.",
