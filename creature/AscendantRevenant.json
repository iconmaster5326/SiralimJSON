They are great engineers who learned to use gunpowder in a continent far from Rodia, as well as a real pain in the neck for the authorities. Although, luckily, they are few in number, these creatures cause so much damage that those who live to tell the tale always describe it as \"unfair.\" Their enemies either explode or are cut down by the Revenant\u0027s companions while trying to tear the devices from their bodies. After the war ends, Rodia\u0027s council will make it a top priority to find a way to reduce the damage these contraptions cause in battle.",
