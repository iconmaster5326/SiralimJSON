After six pints, they came up with a creature capable of detecting the concealment magic that some students use to cheat on exams, without the need for them to be vigilant. After a few shots they decided to get down to business, but the creature they created turned out to be powerful and aggressive. After a fierce battle, both Magi barely managed to escape, and the creature began to reproduce asexually, consuming the magic items it managed to snatch from them. Currently, the government of Rodia offers a reward for hunting these creatures, and the two Magi are suspended indefinitely.",
