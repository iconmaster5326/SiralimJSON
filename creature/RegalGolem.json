Although, in theory, they should not have feelings or a conscience, they have been known to smile after assisting someone in need. According to a Mage\u0027s account from a few decades ago, her Regal Golem showed reluctance to leave a village they were passing through. The following night, the village was attacked by a Carver Shadowstalker that murdered the entire population.",
