For their insolence, he decided to torture them personally, destroy their humanity and turn them into Masochists. The Angler was once the leader of the group, an agile warrior native of Ahruna who wielded two katars. Tartarith liked the exotic weapons and replaced the arms of the entire group with similar ones.",
