The Bilemaw has a tail with markings in the shape of eyes, and when confronted by another of these creatures for its territory, it stretches the skin around these markings as much as possible. Whoever has the smallest eyes will leave the area without violence. In the event of a tie, each one will dig a tunnel of approximately one mile in length and then have a race to decide the winer.",
