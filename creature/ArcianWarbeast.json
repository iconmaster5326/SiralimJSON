A Mage who was resting close by on her way to Vanelin witnessed the event, and she also observed that whatever it was had fallen not far from there. As she got closer, she found a smoking, scorched rock, and she decided to take it away to study. It turned out to contain minerals unknown to this world, and one of them specifically was capable of absorbing magic if the appropriate spell was applied. Thus, this Mage created the Arcian Warbeast, a creature who can mitigate the effects of certain types of magic that take place around it.",
