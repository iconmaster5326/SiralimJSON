For hundreds of years it frightened several towns and villages of what would later be known as Rodia, until a forest ranger discovered that it attacks any humanoid form, regardless of whether it is alive. Once eaten, the creature returns to its lair and does not return until the following night. This is why even today the outskirts of many towns in Rodia are littered with scarecrows.",
