That is, when they expel their \"memories\".\\n\\nFights between Snaptraps take place from time to time, usually because of a dispute over prey, but they are rarely fatal for any of the opponents.\\n\\nThe Sticky Snaptrap uses the suckers on its branches to stick to tree trunks and surprise its prey from unexpected angles. Usually, it does not move from the trunk and uses its sticky branches to catch very small animals and bring them to its mouth, but if larger prey passes under it, it drops and coils to devour it.",
