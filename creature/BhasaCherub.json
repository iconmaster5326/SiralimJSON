Numerous studies have been attempted upon these creatures, but other than that they contain tremendous amounts of magical energy, solid conclusions have been hard to come by despite centuries of attempted studies.\\n\\nThe Bhasa Cherub always glows with a soft light at all times, but when it considers itself imperiled it is capable of emitting an extreme amount of bright light. The gleam is so bright it has been known to erode and bleach materials in the area, burning the shadows of those surrounding it into the walls and ground.",
