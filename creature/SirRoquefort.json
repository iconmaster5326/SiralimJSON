Sir Roquefort fought valiantly, winning the battle before Siralim\u0027s reinforcements could arrive. However, on his deathbed, the sorcerer used all his dark power to transform Sir Roquefort into... well, Sir Roquefort. He remains a brave knight skilled in combat, but now he must be careful not to stay in damp areas for too long, as it could lead to mold infestations.",
