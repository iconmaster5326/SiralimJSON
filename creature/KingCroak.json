They\u0027re much more intelligent than common frogs and interact with each other in ways similar to chimpanzees. Constant play-fighting is part of their daily life, and the group is led by the individual who commands the most respect—usually the strongest. Leader or not, it\u0027s not uncommon to find these creatures for sale on the black market, where it\u0027s recently become trendy to outfit them with crowns.",
