One would think the Pilwiz would have felt threatened as well, but this was never the case. In fact, Sigmund, aware of what would happen if he tried to integrate these creatures into agricultural activities, asked them to dedicate their efforts to other tasks. It was not until the fall of Omnia that the Amphisbaena began to work the fields, but only in private properties, or in regions the Pilwiz were unable to supply due to the distance or weather conditions.",
