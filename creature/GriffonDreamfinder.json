Therefore, their eggs are considered a delicacy in Rodia, and the people in the upper echelons of society often pay a fortune to obtain them. If, in spite of the difficulties, someone manages to steal several eggs, a Griffon Dreamfinder may track that person down, as they are capable of detecting the presence of their relatives at great distances.",
