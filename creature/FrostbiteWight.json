When the blizzards lifted snow and frost from the ground, he fell on his enemies wrapped in a blanket of cold white and blood red. It was believed that Azural had sent him to cover the entire kingdom in ice. However, the Queen of Sithicus foresaw his movements and managed to sabotage his descent by provoking a huge avalanche. Now, he and his castle belong to the Kingdom of Heretics.",
