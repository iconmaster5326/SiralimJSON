Luckily, it hates crowds and never goes near towns and cities, not even small villages. Their genetic memory is very particular, since they remember all the threats to the life of any ancestor they had before being conceived. Of course, capturing one of these creatures is extremely difficult, as they know many tricks, as well as how to hide and where it is better to lay low. However, their peculiar scream provokes interest in some wealthy individuals, so there are often mercenaries trying to hunt them down without much success.",
