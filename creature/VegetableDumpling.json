In addition, they have a sixth sense that warns them of any danger, so traps are often a better option than direct confrontation. The Vegetable Dumpling is even harder to find, and it may even be the rarest creature in the world. Whoever catches one should know that their expertise as a warrior and adventurer is unparalleled.",
