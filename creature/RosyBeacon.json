To maintain the forest\u0027s balance, they often plant trees and shrubs so that other species are not affected by their presence. All beacons participate in this activity, but the Rosy Beacon has the most important role in it, as it is the only one who can create flowers with its power. In this way, it can help the bees with pollination, or its own kind to feed themselves on a particularly rough year.",
