Realizing this, a young scientist who had been investigating these creatures had the idea of pulverizing stones from the walls of one of the temples and tracing a wide perimeter with the resulting pebbles. Indeed, no Wisps were able to get through. Whether it is due to faith or the divine energy of this deity, Rodia must now choose between defiling the temples of Surathli or remaining vulnerable in the face of a terrible threat.\\n\\nThe Wisp Watcher appears as a flame that seeks to provide warmth to those who need it on cold nights... until it opens its great eye and drives those who look at it mad.",
