He succeeded in transferring his soul to a book, though it took some time for him to accept his new life. For several centuries he continued his studies in the tower, until the unexpected arrival of the Familiars. Accustomed to his new life, the Hidden Grimoire welcomed Washburn and her kind. He still lives with the Familiars in this tower, which they renamed Cornell in his honor.",
