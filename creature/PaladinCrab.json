As time passed, more crabs gathered around him. They had learned that being close to the God of Fortune was the easiest way for them to survive. In time, Lister grew fond of them and finally decided these animals needed protection. For this purpose he created the Paladin Crab, a creature that would gladly give its life to prevent its weaker kin from being eaten, no matter who dares to try.",
