Moreover, they are good strategists who divide their roles and know to turn tail and run when they are at a disadvantage.\\n\\nThe Panic Hound fights differently from its packmates, running from side to side without attacking directly. Then, swift as an arrow, it uses its tail to tear at its enemies\u0027 legs so that they lose balance, giving them a huge disadvantage during battle.",
