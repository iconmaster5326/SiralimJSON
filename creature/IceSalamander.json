When they cannot find a hollow space in the ice in which to lay their eggs, they periodically freeze the rock with their powerful breath to help them develop successfully. When these creatures reach maturity, they leave behind a slippery trail of solid ice. Sometimes, many young Ice Salamanders can be seen following an adult one, sliding merrily on the frozen ground.",
