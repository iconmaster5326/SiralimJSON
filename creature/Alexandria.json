Alexandria spends most of his time thinking about how to improve it and ensuring it does not fail, but now that his realm has become accessible, his focus is on outsiders. He is generally hostile to visitors, but if any of them help protect his home, he wilk gladly reward their actions. The God of Falsity is extremely literal, unable to understand metaphors or sarcasm. Indeed, talking to him can be very dangerous unless words are measured correctly.",
