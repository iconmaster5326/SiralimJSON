  "lore": "These creatures approach human cities during the festivities with a single purpose: to spoil everyone\u0027s joy. They are especially creative when it comes to carrying out their perverse plans, deceiving everyone with clever disguises. Fed up with their misdeeds, a powerful businessman from Siralim whose wedding had been ruined by one of these Devils traveled to the Refuge of the Magi and offered an exorbitant sum of money in exchange for a solution to the problem. After some calculations, thirty-seven Magi from the Refuge traveled to Siralim to visit the great Orb that lies beneath the city. There they carried out a complex ritual that lasted for a week but was finally successful. The appearance of all Bunny Devils became so ridiculous that it would be hard for them to deceive anyone ever again.",
