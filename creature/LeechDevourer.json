They were probably considered a failed experiment, and were therefore banished beyond the realms of the Gods. The Leech Devourer is a clear example of this. It is technically able to swallow any animal whole, although in a very awkward way. If it manages to do it, however, its digestive system collapses and ends up killing the Leech.",
