Unfortunately, that made the Temple of Lies accessible through other means.\\n\\nBecause the Jewel Cruncher\u0027s shell emits a powerful, continuous, golden light even after death, it has become the target of many warriors since these events took place. However, Rodia\u0027s Council, or what remains of it, is considering the introduction of a high tax on the sale of products made with this material, as it would be unfair to the craftsmen who use magic to produce the same effect.",
