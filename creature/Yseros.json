When the world is in danger, Yseros is always the first to notice, and she sometimes mobilizes the rest of the Gods to help protect it. Yseros gathered the Gods to act against the tyranny of an old ruler of Siralim. She suggested Milner as their heroine, but, as usual, Vertraag got his own way and the then ruler of Nex was chosen instead.",
