The Laughing Wisp particularly enjoys making use of this ability, especially at night, in old mansions where few people live. There it loves to laugh out loud, while moving from wall to wall or entering decorative objects to terrorize the residents and occasionally provoke a heart attack.",

    "(Whenever it laughs, it sounds as if an entire audience of people is giggling all at once.)",
