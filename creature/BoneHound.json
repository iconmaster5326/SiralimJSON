The Bone Hound has arrived. It is believed that its existence is linked to humans, having come alive at some point to punish them for their insolence. Followed by a pack as hungry for revenge as it is, the Bone Hound bites and tears like the rest of its siblings. However, its fangs inflict wounds that never heal.",
