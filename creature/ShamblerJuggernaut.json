That forgotten, grotesque beast, larger than any boat, was named the Shambler Juggernaut after the pirate captain and his comrades finally managed to subdue it. Soon after landing in Rodia, the captured Juggernaut they had carried with them laid a clutch of eggs, and the pirates, wanting to rebuild their fleet, decided to sell them. Like their mother, these new Juggernauts are fearsome foes both on water and dry land, but also very easy to tame.",
