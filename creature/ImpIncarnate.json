When an old ruler of Siralim declared war on the rest of Rodia, a bright-eyed Imp appeared near some of the towns and cities that had been invaded and could no longer defend themselves. Along with a horde of Imps, this little joke has already plundered several human settlements and does not seem to be stopping soon.",
