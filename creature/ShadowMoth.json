With them, he scared his neighbors and schoolmates, and occasionally made the Shadows hit them when they made him angry.\\n\\nShadow Moths have started to worry the local authorities. Although their behaviour is mostly the same as that of normal moths, their large size frightens the locals, who often anger these creatures when trying to scare them away, causing them to attack. It has recently been found that luckily, the creatures who can create other Shadows can only do so once a day.",
