Its role is to ensure everything is in order in the Temple of Lies, but now, with the realm invaded by countless threats, it is overwhelmed and remains motionless, as its decision-making system is very limited. Fed up with its obvious incompetence, Aurum has ordered it to just remain still. However, when faced with intruders, it must solemnly communicate that, at any moment, death will be applied to them for desecrating the land of the supreme God Aurum.",
