However, the gem itself has no power unless it is placed on their foreheads. After Helmholtz\u0027s fight with Sigmund, the Amethyst Paragon asked him for its freedom, and he refused. However, when the Unicorn Firewalker caught him by surprise and ended his life, this creature managed to escape before Milner arrived to revive him with her Undolim Seraph.",
