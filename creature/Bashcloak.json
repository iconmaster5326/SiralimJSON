They share nests with bats and never feed on them, since they get rid of mosquitoes and other insects that could transmit diseases to them. In return, they continually give off a mist that makes it more difficult for these winged mammals to be preyed upon. When faced with threats, they take flight as high as possible and plummet on their would-be hunters to finish them off.",
