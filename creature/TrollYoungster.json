It became famous thanks to a series of rumors. As they say, it has assaulted caravans on its own, defeated a Thylacine and even confronted an Immortal King. On the other hand, nobody has really seen the Youngster, so it is not known whether it is just an unfounded legend or if there actually is a young and powerful Troll capable of such feats.",
