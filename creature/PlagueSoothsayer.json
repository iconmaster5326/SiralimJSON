Nothing is known about their reproductive cycle or their customs, and no one has seen them sleep or settle anywhere.\\n\\nAlthough it has great skill as a doctor, the Plague Soothsayer prefers to prevent damage rather than repair it. Its main targets are criminal gangs, and it devotes itself to investigate them and set traps. When the evildoers finally fall, the Soothsayer gloats as it throws its coin in the air before its terrified victims.",
