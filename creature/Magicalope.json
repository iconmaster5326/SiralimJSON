Annoyed, he abandoned the creature outside the city, believing the matter was settled. What he did not count on, however, was that the jackalope inside the hat could breed with common rabbits, and very soon the kingdom was dealing with an infestation of these creatures. Today, authorities will pay a handsome sum to anyone who helps contain this threat to Undolim\u0027s ecosystem.",
