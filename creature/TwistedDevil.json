It spends its youth tormenting the condemned with blows and superficial cuts of small weapons, but as an adult it wanders Rodia and other countries to continue its misdeeds. If it survives long enough, its techniques become more devious and less reckless, abandoning robberies and random attacks to devote itself to organized crime.",
