They decided to destroy it, but not only was their magic harmless to it, it also made it mutate with each spell thrown at it. The Infested Slime was grateful for the spells and returned the favor by also casting some at the Djinns. It was not long before it grew bored of the fleeing Djinns and decided to leave the tower and see the world.",
