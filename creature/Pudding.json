This kind of Dumpling awakens for eleven days in the winter and voraciously feeds on any organic matter it finds, so it is one of the few members of this species that is more predator than prey. Unlike other Dumplings, Puddings have an unpleasant taste no matter how they are cooked. However, a chef of great skill can use them to prepare a dessert that has no equal.",
