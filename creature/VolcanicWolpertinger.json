The Smiths of the Scarlet Mountains take advantage of this to lay traps during the night.\\n\\nVolcanic Wolpertingers usually choose warm places to establish their territory. Legend has it that the entrance to the Great Pandemonium is actually in the Frostbite Caverns, which would explain why these creatures can sometimes be found in such a cold place.",
