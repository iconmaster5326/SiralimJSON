After the Unification War, a boy watched from his window as a hooded figure approached and touched a drunkard who was walking down the street. The man collapsed onto the cobblestones as a cat came out of a trash can and started grooming its paw. The boy\u0027s terrified gaze soon met a pair of glowing eyes in the dark. The unknown figure removed its hood, revealing a cat\u0027s head. \"Meow\", said the strange being. The boy screamed so loud he woke up his family. His parents looked at each other in disbelief as he told the story, but when they went out to look for the man they believed had passed out from drunkenness, they found that he was indeed dead.",
