When a group of Revenants decided to live in peace in Ahruna with humans and other creatures of the surface, Dagon emerged from the depths to punish them. With a simple glance of this creature, their bodies began to experience drastic changes. They grew legs, their scales became skin, and they were completely transformed into humans.",
