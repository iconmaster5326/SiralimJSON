Of particular note, Spectres seem to be utterly terrified of Cherubs and will flee at the mere sight of one, panicking and lashing out if cornered. Demigods on the other hand are zealously protective of them, for reasons they refuse to elaborate upon. The reasoning seems to be religious in nature, but none can say for sure.\\n\\nNisha Cherubs seem to be one with the void — they perpetually exist within a dark vaccuum that surrounds them, in which no form of matter of energy at all can be found. Those who gaze into this void report impossible and bewildering sights they often can find no way to explain or put into words, but the more magically attuned simply see true nothingness as if it were a hole in reality.",
