It will appear to be a good-natured satyr and tell anyone it finds that it knows of a beautiful place near the forest entrance where they could go spend the afternoon. Once it guides them there, it will wait until they make a \u0022mistake\u0022. A broken branch, a flower stepped on by accident. Any excuse will do to bludgeon them to death with its heavy mace.",
