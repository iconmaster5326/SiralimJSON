When this happens, the eyes of the lifeless body turn blue, and it moves to undertake bloody revenge on those who aggrieved it in life. If the possessed body successfully takes a life in the name of revenge, it dances on the corpse before moving on to the next victim.\\n\\nThere are reports of Rift Dancers interacting with these creatures. Dancing Wisps often reject them abruptly and look away, though they always end up playing together in the end.",
