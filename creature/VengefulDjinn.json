The Vengeful Djinn was to be the ultimate Djinn, a being imbued with the power of a Nether Orb that would punish the humans who tried to enslave them. However, they were forced to stop its creation before it was ready. The result was a vile, ghostly entity that materialized the deepest fear of whoever was in front of it, even if it was another Djinn or a creature.",
