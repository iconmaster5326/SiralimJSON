They usually made offerings to these creatures in the towns and cities of the Empire, especially to Sphinx Healers. The sick and those unable to walk visited the temples where these creatures lived and offered them great gifts. In return, this creature uttered strange words and the orb it carried with it emitted a dim light. The diseases disappeared and the injured could walk again.",
