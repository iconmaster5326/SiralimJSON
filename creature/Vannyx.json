No more than a decade passed before the Vannyx found themselves in the mines alongside the Rodians, preventing casualties when there was a collapse. In return, they are fed the entrails of all kinds of animals, especially those that are hard to sell on the market. If threatened, they quickly dig a tunnel underground and sneak away at breakneck speed.",
