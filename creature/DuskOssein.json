Their bodies seem to be impervious to damage, but they collapse like any other creature after receiving enough hits. The Dusk Ossein, in fact, constantly behaves as if it had been defeated. It camouflages itself in the ground, and it can be mistaken for a bunch of rocks which color varies depending on where it is. This fact is also used as proof by those who believe the Ossein have a certain degree of consciousness.",
