Such groups are always led by a Hunter who, instead of a shuriken, wields a bow and arrows made of the metal of its old throwing weapon. Some scholars of non-human societies have determined that it symbolizes their decision to abandon their old life. Others say that it is a custom handed down from generation to generation.",
