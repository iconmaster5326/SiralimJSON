The project was named MK.\\n\\nThe Redsteel Construct can easily detach parts of its body and forge weapons of acceptable quality in a matter of seconds. This allows civilians and soldiers to arm themselves quickly if they have lost their weapon or do not have one. It can restore the missing parts of its body simply by getting close to red-hot steel.",
