In such occasions, a Lich Hellcaster will put its fiery hand on the top of its staff and then anoint the other Liches one by one. The process seems to stoke this creature\u0027s flames. Like other Liches, it has a ghostly voice, and when the wind blows strongly through the bony cavities of its skull, gloomy sounds can be heard over the rustle of its tunic.",
