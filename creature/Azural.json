They implored him to placate the snowstorms and the cold, but their words were not heard. However, after the Watcher War, magic was unleashed for the first time on a scale that had never been seen before. And so, Azural opened his eyes on top of a frozen mountain. He never helps with the cold, but he enjoys watching travelers face its adversities.",
