  "lore": "Some Shapeshifters have a genetic mutation that prevents them from maintaining a specific shape for long. They are also unable to fully control what they transform into and fail many times, becoming a palm tree, for example, rather than a fir. In addition, when they change shape, the result is always disastrous and unpleasant to look at. In Shapeshifter societies, these peculiarities are not considered strange or a defect. However, they know very well that their transformations scare other species, so they are often in charge of driving bad-intentioned visitors away.",
