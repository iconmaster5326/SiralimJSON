When the Watcher War came to an end, the Ravens made the decision to lock the Watcher Sentinel within its walls to make sure it did not cause any problems. Since then, there always was a Raven guarding its prison... until an old ruler of Siralim invaded the city and damaged the walls that contained the Sentinel, who managed to escape. The current Guardian\u0027s mission is to find it, alive, and return it to Crux.",
