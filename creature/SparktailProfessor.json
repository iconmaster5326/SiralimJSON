That is why many of these creatures have decided to leave Blue Emerald and integrate into other societies.\\n\\nSparktail Professors are the cornerstone of their community. Even though they can teach anywhere, their most vital task is to oversee the learning of the children of their kind, as once they take the Step, there is no turning back. Even when out of the water, the Professors\u0027 tails allow them to move small objects without touching them.",
