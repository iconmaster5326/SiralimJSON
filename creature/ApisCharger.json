They were considered heralds of the sun and fertility, but there were never any temples in their honor. Today, they are loyal creatures willing to give their own lives to protect their allies. The Apis Charger is not skilled in magic, but it wears traditional armor with which it rams its enemies, dealing devastating damage at the cost of receiving injuries from the recoil.",
