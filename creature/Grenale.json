They especially enjoy stories of battles and adventures, but when a Grenale hears something particularly unpleasant, it often gets upset and explodes, coating everyone around it in beer. Owners of these creatures usually apologize claiming that Grenales cannot control their explosions, but this is absolutely not true.",
