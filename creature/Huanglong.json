They just enjoy watching people, especially when they are happy. In their dragon form they only interact with other dragons, and often promote peaceful attitudes. Indeed, on many occasions they receive visits from one or more dragons who seek their help to settle their differences. However, a few of them end up following dark paths after witnessing the greed and selfishness of other species.",
