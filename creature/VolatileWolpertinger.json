In the end, only one or two reach maturity.\\n\\nThe Volatile Wolpertinger\u0027s hind legs are atrophied, so it spends most of its time in the air or perched on the branches of trees. The experience turns these creatures into expert air hunters, although a wing injury usually means death for them.",
