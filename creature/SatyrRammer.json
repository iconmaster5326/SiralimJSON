To do this, they emptied the interior of these trees and built ladders to allow easy access between the treetops and the underground.\\n\\nThese creatures charge head on regardless of the size or strength of their opponent, taking advantage of their horns. If a Satyr town suffers a massive attack, they jump from the trees and plummet to the ground, sacrificing themselves while taking several Efts with them.",
