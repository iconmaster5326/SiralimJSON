  "lore": "When Taylor decided to kill his father instead of forgiving him for abandoning him, accidentally turning him into a God, a Pit Wraith fed on what he never was. It automatically became the Tormenter. Tartarith and the creature looked at each other for a moment, but before the God could think of killing it, it unfolded before his eyes. The mere presence of this creature arouses vivid images of a happy future in those who abandoned their loved ones, plunging them into a deep sadness.",
