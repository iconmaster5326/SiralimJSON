Torun hates these practices, but his strings of expletives cannot prevent them from gathering at night to dance around their idols.\\n\\nWith a spasmodic dance, the Imp Ritualist moves among its companions, waving its spear while making a tremendous effort not to spill the flammable liquid that it carries in its other hand. This grotesque display surprisingly seems to establish a mystical connection among its allies.",
