Since the dawn of their civilization they have worshipped death, and to them Harvesters are sacred creatures who should not be disturbed under any circumstances. Their lives revolve around their customs and rites, centered on meditation, and they do not seek war with other peoples. However, they also need to defend themselves. All Nine Tailed Harvesters receive combat training from a young age, and all of them use a scythe in battle.",
