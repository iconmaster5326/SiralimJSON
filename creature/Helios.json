However, they are able to survive on the surface, and in times of drought they resort to feeding on shrubs and weeds. Bears and wolves see Helios as potential prey when there is a lack of food, although it is not easy for them to catch one. They are elusive and can feel the vibrations of footsteps around them, so they almost always flee before any of these predators can even approach.",
