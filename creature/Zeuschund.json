Unlike wolves, these dogs have orc-like strength, making them fierce allies in the hunt and on the battlefield. But their true power shows after death—if they\u0027ve bonded deeply with their friends, a sudden heartbeat brings them back. Fueled by raw energy, they rise again, unstoppable and capable of crushing foes that seemed unbeatable.",
