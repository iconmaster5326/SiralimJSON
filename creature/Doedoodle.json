Most Doedoodles ended up as household pets, and over time, very few were trained for combat. But organized crime groups kept breeding and training them to be tougher, often enhancing them with magical treatments. Nowadays, their fur has become tougher, and parts of their body are covered in sharp, armored plates that are just as dangerous as their bite.",
