When one grows up, the matriarch of its drove draws a cross with her horn on the back of the aspiring new warrior. If it cannot stand the pain, it means it was not ready and must wait another year to try again. Not being able to be marked after five attempts or giving up the crusade is considered a disgrace in its culture and punished with exile.",
