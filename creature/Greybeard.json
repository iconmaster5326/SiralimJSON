Their cloaks and staves are their hallmarks, and they have been infused with magic in such a way that they have acquired certain peculiarities. They are capable of finding any member of the order as long as they are within a ten miles radius, and they perceive the presence of intruders within their headquarters from the moment they set foot inside it. At that moment, the pack goes on the attack while barking to alarm the members of the order.",
