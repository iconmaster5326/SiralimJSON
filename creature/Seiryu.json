Over the years, they spread a legend that says each of these dragons has an orb capable of granting infinite wishes. Obviously, anyone with common sense would not believe such nonsense, but a surprising number of individuals were stupid enough to lead hundreds of expeditions from all over the continent in search of these orbs. The Seiryu leave insultingly obvious clues that make their prey overconfident, leading them to believe they are endowed with sublime intelligence. When a ship reaches the place where the orb is supposed to be, a Seiryu causes a whirlwind by twisting and turning under the ship until it sinks. Its goal is not treasure or revenge—the creature is simply having fun.",
