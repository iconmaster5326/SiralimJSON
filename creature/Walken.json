However, Taylor appreciated his work and decided that he would not allow a mere illness to rob him of his services: not even death could be an excuse to quit his job. When Taylor\u0027s father, Tartarith, became a God and murdered him, Walken was released and began to roam the world with no purpose... until the Auditors recruited him as the executor of their plans. Specifically, those that include the words \"tie loose ends\" and always end with a head rolling on the ground.",
