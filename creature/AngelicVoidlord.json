In her youth, she met Dragan, a student of magic who years later would become the most prominent figure in the Refuge of the Magi.\\n\\nThe Angel Voidlord gives off an aura that attracts anyone nearby. Despite its sinister appearance, many people do not take the necessary precautions when approaching it, and the creature takes advantage of this to grab them tightly. Unfortunately, anything that comes in contact with a Voidlord for over ten seconds ceases to exist in an instant, without leaving a single atom behind.",
