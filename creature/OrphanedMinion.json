In this way, they are not only able to channel spells through this link, allowing the minion to cast them, but the minions themselves gain human-like intelligence, as well as the ability to learn magic on their own. Their longevity tends to increase notably, although in the case of turtles, for example, the opposite occurs. On many occasions, the Mage dies before the minion, creating an Orphaned Minion. Some decide to leave Ercath and travel to other places on their own, such as Rodia.",
