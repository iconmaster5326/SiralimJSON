Without intending it, Tenbran reflects in its face the state of mind in which the God of Limbo is at that moment. They became very good friends and debated on countless topics over the years. Upon the arrival of his sister Sevalah, she looked at the creature with a raised eyebrow. \u0022I see you have missed me, little brother,\u0022 she said. Perdition smiled and hugged her tightly while Tenbran watched the scene with its face filled with a sorrow not its own.",
