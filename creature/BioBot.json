The result was disastrous, given the agony that living in a cold metal body meant for the subject, so it was abandoned until a terrorist group managed to get their hands on the files. Today, Bio Bots are pawns who obey orders without question, on the promise that they will be given back their old bodies if they do everything they are told.",
