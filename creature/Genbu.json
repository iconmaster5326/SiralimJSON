At first glance, it may look like a snake going through a turtle, but the truth is they are a single body, and in fact, the snake has no consciousness and is controlled entirely by the turtle\u0027s brain. To hunt prey, it hides both of its heads within its shell, making it look like a rock. Depending on the prey, one head or another will emerge, the fastest and weakest creatures being eaten by the snake, and the slowest and strongest ones by the tortoise.",
