At present, she regrets having helped a ruler of Siralim rise against Rodia and the Gods themselves. Surathli understands that it was her greed for Emblems and that of the other Gods that gave this person so much power. When the Gods gathered, Surathli declared that from then on, they would only accept the Emblems that had fallen in their own realms.",
