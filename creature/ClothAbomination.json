On one occasion, a Bile Abomination vomited on another that was still in progress. One would think the God of Torture would have left it to die slowly, but he was feeling creative that day, so he fixed the damage. Using pieces of cloth from here and there, Tartarith covered the corroded skin of the creature, sewing them to its flesh with very clumsy technique. However, the hands of a God had touched the rags and unknowingly imbued his creation with extraordinary resilience.",
