It often kills the weakest enemies first, taking advantage of the fact that they are usually sent to the front lines, then uses their blood to store powerful spells in its scepter to decimate the strongest enemies. If it gets bored, it sometimes hunts stray animals or people, cutting them until they bleed to death.",
