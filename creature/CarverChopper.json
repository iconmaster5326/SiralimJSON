At first it will make sporadic appearances, observing its victim quietly from a distance, as if it were just a part of the landscape that doesn\u0027t quite fit. With time, however, it will begin to gradually approach its victim until it\u0027s close enough and the hunt begins. If it butchers you with its merciless cleaver inside the dream, you will never wake up.",
