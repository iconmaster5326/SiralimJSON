Advances in the field of magic have long allowed it to walk on the surface without drowning or exploding into a thousand pieces due to the pressure differences between the two environments. It is very patient and can spend hours, even days, lurking in the darkness while waiting for a fish to run into one of its terrible pincers. However, this technique is useless on the surface, so it will wait and wait without any prey approaching it until it starves.",
