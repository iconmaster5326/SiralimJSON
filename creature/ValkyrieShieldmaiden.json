In a matter of seconds, his ships began to fall from the skies above Omnia, marking the beginning of the battle for Rodia\u0027s unification. Today, this feat is known as the \"Dance of the Valkyries\". The Shieldmaidens served as the vanguard of the Valkyries during the siege of Omnia. They blocked hundreds of arrows and spells, allowing their sisters to reach the walls.",
