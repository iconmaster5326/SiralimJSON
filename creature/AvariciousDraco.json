Those people who do not know how to listen to anything other than their own voice and who, in general, do not have any real friends because no one is able to put up with them. In the case of the Avaricious Draco, each and every one of the individuals that make up the species are the spitting image of such a lack of empathy, common sense, and desire to reflect. Conversations between these creatures are always about who is better at doing something, and can drag on for hours, becoming an endless parade of fictional bragging rights. They are the laughingstock of other dracos, who use the name Narcissistic Draco to refer to them. Indeed, that name has begun to stick, although their greed is also well known.",
