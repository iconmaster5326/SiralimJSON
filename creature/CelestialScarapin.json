The Celestial Scarapin, when hungry, hides its body in the foliage, leaving only its tail and wings visible, which resemble flowers. It waits for its prey to approach, then strikes with deadly precision. When attacking, it absorbs some of the damage and transforms it into energy that strengthens its skin.",
