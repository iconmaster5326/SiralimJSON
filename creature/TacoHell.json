Indeed, it can be said that there is often a lost traveler who bumps into Vulcanar \u0027by pure chance\u0027, or not, depending on whether you ask the God of Fire or anyone with common sense. These individuals have varied fates, generally a gruesome death or the fortune to avoid it. The case of the Taco Hell started with a very hungry individual, and ended with the question \u0022A taco big enough to eat you?\u0022 that the God of Fire asked, receiving a \u0022yes\u0022 for an answer.",
