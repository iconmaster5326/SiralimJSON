He is very talkative and a prankster, and he gets along well with the God of Fusion, although sometimes he can be too much for T\u0027mere, who asks him to shut up. He sometimes goes too far with his pranks as well—for example, he once played dead after fighting a bunch of criminals. T\u0027mere knew perfectly well that he was alive, but did not find it amusing and stopped talking to him for two weeks.",
