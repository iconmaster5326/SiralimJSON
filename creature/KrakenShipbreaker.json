However, in reality, only Kraken Shipbreakers do this, and not for fun, but because large ships scare away the prey on which they feed. Today, ships are equipped with a state-of-the-art magical device that mitigates the vibrations produced when sailing, so these Krakens are no longer a problem on high sea routes.",
