The story of the Fog Spirit goes back to that of William James, a famous pirate who sailed the waters for decades and discovered impossible places. His last journey took him to an island that floated above the northern sea, where he found a magnificent treasure. A cursed treasure. The Fog Spirit appeared when this happened, and it has traveled the world since, breaking minor curses.",
