Skull Devils need to reap at least one life every day or they become dust, but, as they are banned from all the cities in Rodia, they wait in areas where merchant caravans usually camp for the night. When a group of travelers arrives, the Devil comes out of the shadows and uses its scythe to cut off the head of any traveler who wanders off from the group.",
