Most of them live in the depths and do not poke their heads out of the water very often, while the Abyssal Kraken never does. Other Krakens consider it an absolute sovereign, and only under its command are they able to carry out joint attacks. Although in ancient times their strategies overwhelmed the Revenants, nowadays the Abyssal Kraken\u0027s main task is help as many Krakens as possible to survive when one of their nests is discovered.",
