Like most Dumplings, these creatures are very elusive. However, those who obtain one are undoubtedly blessed with good luck. It is as if the universe conspired so that everything that happens around this creature ends well for those nearby, which has led to terrible stories about the consequences of eating a Squash, as well as explanations from more skeptical people who think the Squash simply affects the world around it with some sort of magic.",
