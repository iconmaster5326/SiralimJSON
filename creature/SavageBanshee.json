Its screams can stop the heart of a weak-willed person, and a touch of its hand leads even the happiest people to despair. Aware of the danger this creature posed, Erebyss decided to destroy it. However, it has managed to regenerate over the centuries, and soon the time will come for it to sow chaos in Rodia.",
