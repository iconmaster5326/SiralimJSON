If the issue at hand is complex and requires extra attention, the Soulflayer Deprivers delay the need for these creatures to sleep so they can solve it as soon as possible. Before a battle, Soulflayer Deprivers infiltrate the enemy\u0027s ranks and prevent them from falling asleep so they are drowsy and exhausted when they go to battle.",
