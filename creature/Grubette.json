Females are exceptional hunters and their preferred prey is the Arachnalisks. It is not uncommon for Grubettes to leave the Arachnid Nest, but when they do they only visit large cities to trade with other creatures. Since they do not have vocal cords, they communicate with other intelligent species through hand gestures. Once they finish trading, they immediately return home.",
