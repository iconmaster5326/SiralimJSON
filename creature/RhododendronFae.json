When it gets dark, the mushrooms that sprout on many of its trees emit a fluorescent light in many colors.\\n\\nThe Rhododendron Fae\u0027s flapping makes no sound. In addition, they are capable of altering both the intensity and the color of their trails, naturally pink, and are even able to make them invisible. Even at night, a Fae\u0027s trail is not visible at great distances, especially in the thicket, but this ability makes Rhododendron Fae virtually undetectable and the best creatures for a surprise attack.",
