  "lore": "The Fae Lands is a lush forest where day and night cycles are ten times longer. When it gets dark, the mushrooms that sprout on many of its trees emit a fluorescent light in many colors.\\n\\nThe Rhododendron Fae\u0027s flapping makes no sound. In addition, they are capable of altering both the intensity and the color of their trails, naturally pink, and are even able to make them invisible. Even at night, a Fae\u0027s trail is not visible at great distances, especially in the thicket, but this ability makes Rhododendron Fae virtually undetectable and the best creatures for a surprise attack.",

    "(Each Fae is making a rude gesture at you. One is sticking her tongue out, while another is proudly showing off her middle finger. Are they unaware that you could squash them like bugs?)",
    "(Upon your approach, one of the Fae pulls another\u0027s wings off. Luckily, these creatures seem to reproduce quickly enough that they\u0027re expendable.)",
