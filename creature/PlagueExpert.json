While its people cured the sick, the Expert wrote strange symbols in its book that no one recognized. The presence of this creature is now a beacon of hope, and it lifts the spirits of the people wherever it goes. Moreover, it is believed that its book contains the supreme knowledge of medicine, and many long to learn its secrets.",
