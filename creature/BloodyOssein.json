Early research on these creatures indicates that they are very similar to Golems.\\n\\nThe Titan\u0027s blood is extremely hot, but this does not seem to affect the Osseins, perhaps because they come from the same entity. The Bloody Ossein was imbued with this blood at birth, which always remains in its body thanks to the power of Mortem. This allows the creature to control other Osseins and organize them for joint attacks.",
