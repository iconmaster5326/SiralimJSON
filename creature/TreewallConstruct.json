After dismissing hundreds of workers and agitating the competition, especially the Pilwiz, social unrest began to grow right during the recent war. In the absence of the then ruler of Nex, who was in Siralim to defeat the tyrant who threatened to conquer Rodia, Ilberd had no choice but to make drastic decisions during these events. Specifically, he decreed that the number of Constructs on each company\u0027s workforce can never exceed 3%.",
