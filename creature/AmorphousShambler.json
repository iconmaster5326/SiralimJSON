The waters were riddled with amorphous beings capable of levitating in their unlife. At first, some of the captain\u0027s crew thought they might be edible, but their rotten stench was warning enough not to. Sea Shamblers are not aggressive creatures by nature, but when the captain\u0027s ships sailed over shoals of these creatures, many were hit hard, causing a fight in which no member of the crew lost their life.",
