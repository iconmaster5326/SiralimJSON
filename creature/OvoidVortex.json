Since the Dragons were too busy dealing with the Watchers, Aeolian was the first to notice their presence... and the first to ask them to abandon his realm. But he also knew of Kaito\u0027s plight, and seeing how respectful those people had been gave him an idea: he would let them stay for a generation before making a choice. When the time was up, Aeolian found that the humans had not only survived while preserving nature, but also improved the state of his realm wherever they had settled. Those refugees became the first humans to live in the Unsullied Meadows. In a gesture of gratitude and praise, Aeolian created the Ovoid Vortex to protect them, inspired by the Omelettes that lived with the refugees.",
