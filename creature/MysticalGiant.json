That infuriated the God of Anger, who was already furious to begin with, so he challenged Vulcanar to a duel between his final Giant and whatever \u0022PIECE OF !@#$\u0022 the Elemental King wanted. This is how the Mystical Giant was born, a 35-foot Giant with skin as hard as steel and the strength of a seventeen-ton killing machine.",
