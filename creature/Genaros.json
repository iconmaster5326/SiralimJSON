That faith that traveled almost the entire continent gave life to Genaros, a God who, far from being vengeful, even extolled indiscriminate slaughter as long as it had the purpose of filling the stomach of another living being. However, over time he was forgotten and the borders of his realm simply ceased to be seen with the naked eye. Recently, a group of Rodian Magi found a way to enter the Overgrown Temple, causing that mist to disappear. Genaros is always talking about hunting and does not tolerate any type of violence that is not related to survival in the strictest sense of the word. He charges with all his anger against any criminal who enters his realm.",
