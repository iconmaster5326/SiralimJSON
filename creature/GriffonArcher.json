In the past, there was a Hunter who found a Griffon chick that had been abandoned by its flock due to the black color of its feathers. The Hunter raised the chick and taught it how to use a bow when it grew up. Together they wandered Rodia, facing innumerable dangers until, one day, the adventurer passed away due to old age. The Griffon Archer still flies over the country, fighting injustice single-mindedly.",
