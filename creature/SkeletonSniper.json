They come from a very distant and completely unknown land, and their body is devoid of flesh and organs due to a curse they received on an island full of ancient treasures. They usually attack from a distance with technology that does not exist in this country, and though the shots of the Skeleton Sniper are not exactly deadly, they do have a long range.",
