However, they usually just look like shapeless masses that leave trails of radioactive waste in their path.\\n\\nThe Swordslime is the only Concoction who chooses relatively humanoid forms, if humans and other intelligent bipedal creatures will pardon the expression. It often lies on the floor and pretends to be a fallen warrior with a sword stuck in the chest, but when its victim turns around, the Swordslime stands up, ready to strike them down in a single backstabbing blow. Quite a cowardly creature.",
