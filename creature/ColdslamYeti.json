Like the rest of the Yetis, it prefers to live in high mountains covered with snow and ice, although its thick fur allows it to adapt to almost any environment. These creatures can summon blizzards when they get angry, and even turn summer into a terrible winter for an entire city, which is why the authorities no longer allow them entry.",
