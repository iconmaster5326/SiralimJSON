The frightened Queen got out of bed and desperately looked for him. Near the stables, she found the Entropic Spectre holding her son, although she did not know its true nature. The Queen vanquished the Spectre with ease, but as it vanished she realized in shock that its existence and her son\u0027s life had merged into one.",
