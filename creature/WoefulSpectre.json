It can tear through time with its knife and create temporal rifts with which to move to other eras. The dark lord is said to have disappeared through a rift when he was about to be defeated by Helmholtz and Milner. Another theory is that Sigmund became this creature, and all these events were orchestrated by Vertraag.",
