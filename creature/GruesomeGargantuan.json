These creatures will fight for any cause if promised a nice helping of quartz. The Watcher War ravaged many human towns and cities, but also some settlements of other intelligent creatures that lived in the mountains. Torun did not take this into account and the result was the Gruesome Gargantuan. Magic acts unpredictably around it, and manifests spontaneously to damage its enemies.",
