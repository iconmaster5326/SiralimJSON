Indeed, they are so difficult to control that even organized gangs prefer to do without their services.\\n\\nThe few Rodian scientists that have dared to study Maniacs have discovered that the Maniac Builder\u0027s extra arms sprout during what seems to be their adolescence. The reason behind this evolutionary quirk is a mystery, and at present, their job within the tribe is limited to erecting palisades and the rough mud huts in which their people live.",
