Sometimes he used magic, other times he experimented on them, and yet other times he simply used sharp or pointed tools to inflict pain.\\n\\nWhen a Clutcher grabs its victims, it always digs its nails deep into their body. Additionally, the Venomous Clutcher uses its stinger to poison the victim, producing a high fever and intense pain in the limbs.",
