That is why the Rodians quickly discovered that trying to chase them can be as dangerous as climbing to the top of a mountain during a thunderstorm.\\n\\nThe wheat and corn fields of Hutika are infested with Spade Luckmantrias, something the Uraloses are not precisely excited about. Though Luckmantrias do not feel threatened by these beings, sometimes they could be injured by accident, if it were not because someone forgot a harvesting instrument among the branches that fortuitously ended up stamped on a Uralos snout.",
