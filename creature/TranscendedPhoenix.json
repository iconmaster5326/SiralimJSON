Females gain the ability to lay an unlimited number of eggs, although their offspring is always of the father\u0027s subspecies. The number of Phoenixes was considerably reduced in the Unification War. To repopulate the species, Helmholtz and Milner searched for two Transcended Phoenixes, a male and a female.",
