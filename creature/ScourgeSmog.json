They are a constant problem for the humans and Pilwiz who work the land, because of the resentment they feel toward these activities. For their part, farmers especially detest the Scourge Smog, as the red smoke it emits can quickly dehydrate the crops. Entire harvests have been lost because of these creatures.",
