Instead, it deposits the poison it produces in strategic places in the forest, waiting for a creature to step on it or lick it by mistake. Animals such as badgers or owls are instantly paralyzed and die within a few seconds. The existence of this creature became known after a Flamehook Pilwiz started a great fire in Andolin.",
