  "lore": "The Wyvern Toxicfang is such a rare specimen that for a long time it was considered a legend. It rarely moves during the day, and it never attacks prey directly. Instead, it deposits the poison it produces in strategic places in the forest, waiting for a creature to step on it or lick it by mistake. Animals such as badgers or owls are instantly paralyzed and die within a few seconds. The existence of this creature became known after a Flamehook Pilwiz started a great fire in Andolin.",
