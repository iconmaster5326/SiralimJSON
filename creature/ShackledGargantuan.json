It woke up full of unbridled rage and began to destroy everything in its path. Torun was disappointed, as it is not necessary to kill mortals to humiliate them. However, he also felt pity. He finally decided to chain it and leave it hidden, hoping that it would change its attitude over time. It only took two days for him to forget about it.",
