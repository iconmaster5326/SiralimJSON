Great power can be obtained by eating them, and some believe that consuming their flesh can even grant extraordinary abilities such as immortality or telekinesis. They are very sociable and enjoy the company of other creatures, but their delicious appearance and the legends surrounding them often turn them into prey... if one can catch them before they flee.",
