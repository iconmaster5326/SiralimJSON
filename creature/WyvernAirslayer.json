However, Wyvern Airslayers pose a problem for these ecosystems, as they kill other creatures for pleasure instead of necessity. There was once a Wyvern Windrider who went into the Torture Chamber and made the mistake of facing Tartarith. The God of Punishment easily subdued the creature and played with it for several days, corrupting its nature until it became the first Airslayer.",
