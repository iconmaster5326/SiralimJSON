    "Luck is not merely a matter of chance, but instead a force that can be manipulated to a clever man\u0027s will. Tricksters capitalize on this fact, enabling their creatures to re-roll the proverbial dice whenever fate doesn\u0027t turn out quite the way they hoped.",
    "As a Trickster, you\u0027ll heavily inconvenience your enemies by preventing them from taking action. You\u0027ll also gain the ability to manipulate the element of luck - for example, if a positive effect has a chance to activate but fails to do so, you can try again."
