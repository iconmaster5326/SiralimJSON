    "The difference between good and evil is often a matter of perspective, but the morality of a Defiler is simple enough for anyone to decide. These dark magi take sadistic pleasure in afflicting their adversaries with crippling diseases, reducing them to weakened husks that no longer have the capacity to defend themselves.",
    "As a Defiler, you\u0027ll specialize in debuffs and stat-reducing effects. Enemies will be so weak that your party will be able to easily pick them off, even if they were originally much more powerful than your creatures."
