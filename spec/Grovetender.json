    "Grovetenders take great pride in their Herbling companions, strongly preferring to focus the bulk of their efforts on this prized creature over all the others. This peculiar mage knows just the right techniques to bring out her Herbling\u0027s full potential as it transforms rapidly in combat to wreak havoc on its foes.",
    "As a Grovetender, you will always have a unique creature in your party called an Herbling. During battle, your creatures\u0027 actions will fertilize the Herbling, causing it to rapidly evolve until it turns into an unstoppable force of nature."
