    "Some creatures are blessed with protectors that guard them from harm no matter the cost. The Mermaid relies on her Benthic Guardian to shield her other creatures from danger, ensuring that her allies can fight without fear while her guardian bears the brunt of the enemy\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s fury.",
    "As a Mermaid, you\u0027ll focus on healing your creatures and raising their defenses, making them incredibly durable. Your Benthic Guardian serves as the heart of your strategy, acting as both a shield and a conduit for your most powerful effects."
