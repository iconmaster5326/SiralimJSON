    "A blade can cut the body, but the mind is far more fragile. The Mesmerist specializes in warping reality itself, putting her enemies to sleep, blinding them, and turning their own senses against them until they no longer know who - or what - they\u00E2\u20AC\u2122re fighting.",
    "As a Mesmerist, you\u0027ll manipulate buffs and debuffs to disrupt your enemies while empowering your own creatures. Sleeping and Blind enemies suffer devastating penalties, while your creatures twist spells and status effects into unexpected weapons."
