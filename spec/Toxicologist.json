    "Toxicologists spend their days tarrying away at all manner of potions and elixirs that might serve their use in battle. These mad scientists care little for the well-being of their own creatures, equipping them with venomous toxins that grant them enhanced combat prowess at the cost of their own lives.",
    "As a Toxicologist, you\u0027ll use the Poison debuff to inflict massive damage over time to your foes. You\u0027ll also Poison your own creatures to generate beneficial effects when they take damage."
