    "Pyromancers quite literally thrive on watching the world burn. These maniacal magi ignite both friend and foe alike with a brilliant conflagration, causing their enemies to suffer gruesome deaths while empowering their allies with the power of flame.",
    "As a Pyromancer, you\u0027ll make heavy use of the Burning debuff to deal damage to enemies over time. In addition, your own creatures will be afflicted with this debuff, but it will heal and empower them rather than dealing damage."
