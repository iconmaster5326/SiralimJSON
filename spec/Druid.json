    "Many people foolishly mistake a Druid\u0027s introversion for weakness. These magi believe that quality always trumps quantity on the battlefield. Contrary to tradition, they are often seen with fewer than six creatures at their disposal, but the havoc their limited numbers wreak when augmented by Druidic magic is a sight to behold.",
    "As a Druid, you\u0027ll probably only want to have one (or up to four, later on) creatures in your party. Your creatures will gain massive benefits for being part of a smaller party."
