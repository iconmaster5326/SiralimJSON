    "Necromancers prefer to overwhelm their foes by summoning minions to aid their creatures in battle. Enemies are often so perplexed by the number of undead monstrosities charging at them from across the battlefield that they\u0027re dead long before they realize what even happened.",
    "As a Necromancer, you\u0027ll summon minions to aid your creatures in battle. These minions can do all kinds of things to support your creatures - they can cause damage, boost your creatures\u0027 stats, debuff enemies, and much more."
