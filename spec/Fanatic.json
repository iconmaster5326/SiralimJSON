    "Fanatics devote their lives to serving the gods. From dusk until dawn, these magi toil away at a neverending list of demands to better serve each of the 30 gods of Rodia. Such devotion is not without purpose, however, for the Fanatic is able to call on the gods\u0027 power to serve him in his time of need.",
    "As a Fanatic, you\u0027ll be able to take additional Avatar creatures with you on your journey and empower them and their Ultimate Spell Gems with potent magic. Fanatics also make use of Godspawn creatures and create powerful synergies between them and their Avatar allies."
