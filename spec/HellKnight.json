    "Careful planning and uptight caution are nothing but a cause to doubt oneself. Hell Knights realize this fact, and instead opt to send their creatures charging headlong into battle, relying on brute strength and reckless attacks to ensure a swift victory.",
    "As a Hell Knight, you\u0027ll favor creatures that specialize in attacking. Hell Knights grant their creatures increased critical damage and cause a variety of effects to occur when they attack. Hell Knights are surprisingly adept at spellcasting in a pinch, as well."
