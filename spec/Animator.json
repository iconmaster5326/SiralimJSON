    "There\u0027s a fine line between genius and insanity, and it\u0027s difficult to say on what side of that line Animators reside. These fanatical magi spend their days perfecting their Animatus creations: unique creatures that grow more powerful as their master\u0027s dark experiments unveil new opportunities.",
    "As an Animator, you will always have a unique creature in your party called an Animatus. Your entire battle strategy will likely focus on this creature. You can empower your Animatus, and even use your other creatures to make it stronger in combat."
