    "Astrologers are calculating magi who specialize in creating a sound strategy before each battle. Oftentimes, their plans are so well-constructed that their creatures are able to take combat into their own hands without any further input from their master.",
    "As an Astrologer, you\u0027ll plan most of your battle strategies before combat even begins. Astrologers allow their creatures to act on their own under certain conditions."
