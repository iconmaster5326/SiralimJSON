This former creature was discarded as a disappointment by the God of Wisdom and was thought to be lost forever in the annals of history. It was only by luck that the Lost Construct came in contact with the Nether Orb of Sorcery, enabling it to ascend to a higher power and seek out revenge on those who disbelieved in its power.",
