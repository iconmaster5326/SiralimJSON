His most notable find, however, was the fact that Spell Gems leave a mark on a soul, one that remains at the very least throughout the entire process of transmigration. With great caution he created a Grimoire that was able to manipulate this magic. He gave it a terrifying appearance, hoping to scare the looters, but also gave it a personality that would drive it to take care of animals, trying to make amends for the many creatures that had died for his research. However, for obvious reasons, animals usually flee in terror at its presence.",

Zonte\u0027s master, Ainsworth, participated in the research when she was a mere apprentice. It all started with an immensely powerful Nether Orb and the idea of creating a weapon that would allow several Magi to channel huge amounts of magic to cast the same spell together and even mix different ones. However, the calculations were erroneous, as Ainsworth described in her doctoral dissertation on the creation of magical objects using Nether Orbs as catalysts. Instead of creating the perfect weapon, the staff came alive and did not take too well to the Magi casting several spells on it. After disintegrating four members of the research team, Laglor left the tower and began its mysterious pilgrimage around the world.",

He hurried to point 0 and found her completely disfigured and catatonic. He had to remove the nine Nether Orbs to save the tower, and each one would consume seven years of his life. Looking like an old man but still feeling young, he teleported to Siralim, built on top of a gigantic Nether Orb, to become a God and stop the impending disaster. But he had miscalculated, for he needed a tenth Orb. It was then that Vertraag suddenly appeared and handed it to him.",

At nightfall, she led them down a path among the trees, waited for them to get lost and hid herself. She would end the stories, yes, but why not give them a good scare first? Her friends, frightened, began to call her in increasingly loud voices. When they were just about to panic, the girl dropped from a tree and roared as if she were a ferocious beast. Her friends turned around, but their reaction was not what she expected. They looked pale and were paralyzed by fear, looking in the girl\u0027s direction but not at her. Her heart sank as she slowly turned around and met the ghostly eyes of the Tanukrook.",

While they debated about its possible species around the bonfire, the block of ice began to crack and the creature emerged. They did not understand how it could have survived or how the ice had broken, but it seemed like a kind and loving creature, so the explorers went to sleep without a worry. Upon awakening, they realized the creature had stolen all their money, as well as important tools and climbing gear. With great difficulty, they returned to the capital and looked for information about what had happened to them. They had been lucky. A student at the Magic University of Andolin explained that the creature was believed to be extinct, in part because its extermination had been ordered. This creature is kind and gentle while it is cold, and it can use ice to enter a state of stasis indefinitely, but when it gets warm it becomes a deceitful, malicious being who sometimes kills others for fun.",

Otherwise, it would have been destroyed, and they would have been expelled, as this type of magic was forbidden without a permit, especially to students. For years, the two friends believed they were hiding their secret well, until a promising new student visited the facilities, shortly before they graduated. The little boy stared at the spot in Hexilo\u0027s bedroom where he had hidden it with an invisibility spell. That could have meant anything, especially in the bedroom of a Magi student, but the little boy felt a strange presence and began to cast a spell of Dispel. Luckily, before he could finish, Hexilo grabbed him by the arm and led him to the common room to taste the blueberry pie his schoolmates had prepared. There, the boy brought up the subject of the bedroom again. \u0022Zonte! Be more respectful of your elders!\u0022 his mother exclaimed. Everyone laughed except that boy. Two months later, Hexilo left the Refuge of Magi, taking Linta with him, and it remained at his side even after he went into the Titan\u0027s Wound.",

In reality, they both studied together at the Refuge of the Magi, and were very good friends, but Hexilo left the kingdom after graduating and unleashed chaos in a nearby nation with his experiments. In the midst of one of their countless battles, Dragan himself, one of the two founders of the Auditors, appeared in person and stopped the fight, not without some difficulty. Hexilo accepted the offer without hesitation, fascinated by the idea of the organization; while River, who had serious doubts, only did it to keep tabs on his arch-enemy. For over ten years, Hexilo worked for the Auditors under the codename Twilight. After the incident in the Refuge of the Magi, the number of Voidlords increased exponentially. Sevalah knew that even the power of Tenebris would be insufficient to create a place capable of attracting the Voidlords to reduce their influx, so she designed a plan in which Mortem would also participate. Thus, the two ancient rivals created the Bastion of the Void.",

The Elves, hidden in the woods, were the main foes of this Dark Lady, the only ones who were not exterminated despite the fact that they would not leave their home under any circumstances. Elinar was their most powerful warrior, but the Auditors tried to recruit him before the war came to an end. Elinar accepted the offer, but he would only join them when the war ended. The Auditors assured him that the land of the Elves could never fall to the empress, and that she would be betrayed by one of her own in less than a year. Still Elinar declined the offer. The next morning, the empress was dead. According to one of the survivors in the castle, five Carnages and a \u0022big eye\u0022 had taken her down after overwhelming her personal guard. For the eleven years he worked with his five companions in the organization, Elinar used the codename Morning Star.",

After a few years, his friend began to develop an affinity for the dark arts, and later, when River left the Refuge of the Magi, he began to hear stories of a necromancer who terrorized a kingdom near Siralim, beyond the lands that would be known as Rodia a few centuries later. Convinced it was his old friend, River traveled to that kingdom and found that he was right. For several years they fought each other until both of them joined the Auditors. Together with four other agents they formed the Enclave of Six, and River led the group. The six Magi carried out many missions throughout the world. Following the incident in the Refuge of the Magi, River transformed into Tenebris. He soon found that using divine power was not much different from using magic, something that neither Apocranox nor Venedon had done up to that very moment. Using each other\u0027s power he helped them create their own realms. He later created the Bastion of the Void together with Mortem, and, after saying goodbye to his friends, he left this world.",

After decades of research, he found a way to build a devastating Golem using cursed items and materials, extracted from different curse-laden places in Rodia. Replicating his feat is not an easy task, but a Mage of great knowledge and talent has recently succeeded. The Animatus can absorb and harness the strength of its allies and become much more dangerous... at a price.

When the Unification War came to an end, many Seraphs of the newly founded Rodia had lost their wings and ability to reproduce due to the fall of the kingdoms they served, or rather, those they were forced to serve. However, a group of these homeless Seraphs came to Surathli and asked for mercy. The Goddess pondered for a moment and decided to give them back their ability to spawn new Seraphs, uniting them all into one single lineage. These Seraphs all took different paths, but they always used their new blade to carry out the designs of the forces of good. Some of them began to protect the ruins of Kaito from looters. Given the great cultural value of those ruins, archeologists and historians began calling these creatures \u0022Keepers of Knowledge\u0022, or even \u0022Kaito Seraphs\u0022, as they are commonly known today.",

Fascinated by the living artistic display that was there, he decided to bring a human friend, the person he trusted the most. Very soon they met Emus, the second in command. She kindly asked them to keep the existence of that place a secret, fearing the inevitable if it became known. The Raven and the human understood her request and reassured her that they already planned to try to hide her existence from the world. Emus thanked them deeply, and in time a good friendship blossomed. The Raven later cast a powerful spell that further concealed the entrance, but also warned Emus that sooner or later someone would find a way to bypass the wards, a prediction that hundreds of years later would come true.",

The failed ritual had changed them, and after so many generations they had learned to use a strange power based on the accumulation of gravity under their hoods. The two Magi led these creatures to Rodia, and most of them now live a simple life.",

A necromancer Solomon who had studied magic in Siralim managed to revive some of his own kind by creating the Skelegoop.
